    This amendment lies at the heart of issues on the left &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; right: gay marriage, contraceptive rights, gerrymandering, gun rights, affirmative action. Can you guess what it is?

  <div property="text articleBody">
    <p>This amendment lies at the heart of issues on the left <em>and</em>
right: abortion rights, gay marriage, contraceptive rights,
gerrymandering, gun rights, affirmative action, resolving the
Presidential Election of 2000, and the status of women in the draft. If
you care about any of these subjects, no matter you opinion, you
<strong>have</strong> to understand the constitutional amendment at the
center all of those debates in order to have an informed opinion. It is
the most influential part of the constitution on daily life. It’s not
any of the Bill of Rights; They actually had a legal loophole that this
amendment would close.</p>
<p>Can you guess what it is?</p>
<p>I am of course, referring to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Fourteenth
Amendment</a>. The Fourteenth is unique even among other “freedom
granting” amendments because it does not protect any <em>specific
liberty</em> (for example, freedom of speech); Instead it protects
<em>liberty in general</em>. As a consequence, it has been used to give
us liberties that its framers could never have imagined, such as access
to contraception. This opens the door for a non-legislative policy
response to unequal institutions, like money bail, when state and
federal legislatures are too gridlocked to act. But to get there, we
have to start with the historical context.</p>
<h1 id="historical-context-briefly">Historical Context (briefly)</h1>
<p>The North won the Civil War and outlawed slavery in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Thirteenth
Amendment</a> (finally). Being nominally free wasn’t enough;
abolitionists realized that they needed protection from persecution by
the government and other citizens. They legislated the Fourteenth
Amendment to protect newly freed slaves, but its provisions protect all
Americans, so it has huge implications for society today. There are
three important clauses I will discuss: the Privileges and Immunities
Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<h1 id="privileges-and-immunities-clause">Privileges and Immunities
Clause</h1>
<p>I am not a legal scholar or historian, so I may have mistakes; feel
free to mention them in the comments.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights">The
Bill of Rights</a> is the first ten amendments to the constitution,
which guarantees a litany of rights including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom of religion</li>
<li>Freedom of speech</li>
<li>Right to bear arms</li>
<li>And others</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all of these limitations on governmental action only apply
to the <strong>federal government</strong> not <strong>state
governments</strong> (confirmed by <a
href="governments**%20(confirmed%20)"><em>Barron v. Baltimore</em></a>.
The framers largely trusted the state governments and were only
skeptical of a tyrannical federal government for three reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The idea of the thirteen former colonies operating as a single
nation was still new. They volunteered to work together in the
Revolutionary War and then in the Articles of Confederation, but still
mostly operated as a loose confederation of states while the
Constitution was being drafted.</p></li>
<li><p>State governments were directly elected, while many parts of the
federal government were indirectly elected or appointed (the Senate, the
President, the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the cabinet,
etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The seat of federal power was distant given the modes of
transportation available at the time, but the state capitol was usually
only a few days away by horseback.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, the state governments <em>were</em> responsive to the
people… as long as “the people” were white and male. Abolitionists in
the North saw that the South couldn’t be trusted to be anything but
tyrannical to the newly-freed slaves. The framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment in 1868 set out to rectify what the framers of the Bill of
Rights in 1789 overlooked: the Constitution would need to limit
<em>state</em> governments in order to preserve civil liberties for all
Americans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the effect of this clause all hinges on how one defines
“privileges and immunities.” The framers intended to include the Bill of
Rights and other rights, but they did not want to enumerate them lest
the amendment be limited to <em>only the Bill of Rights</em>. However,
this plan backfired: in a 5-4 decision known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughter-House_Cases"><em>The
Slaughter-House Cases (1873)</em></a>, the Supreme Court interpreted
“privileges and immunities” narrowly, <em>not even including the Bill of
Rights</em>! This single decision renders the whole clause nearly
irrelevant, and it is rarely used today.</p>
<p>Yale Law Professor <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhil_Amar">Akhil Amar</a> wrote
“virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and center—thinks that
<em>Slaughter-House</em> is a plausible reading of the [Fourteenth]
Amendment.” The Court usually gives deference to the intention of the
framers, and in this case, the Congressional record itself holds their
discussion that they intended the Amendment protect the Bill of Rights!
Unfortunately, once the Court settles on something, it is extremely
difficult to reverse, due to a doctrine known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent#United_States_legal_system"><em>stare
decisis</em></a>. Instead, legal advocates would turn to the Due Process
Clause to provide the basic freedoms of the Bill of Rights for the
newly-freed slaves.</p>
<p>However, there are some signs that almost a hundred-and-fifty years
later, the court is willing to revisit this decision. Justice Clarence
Thomas in <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago</em> (which I will describe
later), used the Privileges and Immunities Clause to arrive at his
decision, indicating he may be willing to overrule
<em>Slaughter-House</em> in the future.</p>
<h1 id="due-process-clause">Due Process Clause</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/raw-binary/most-important-amendment/arthur-dent.jpg" title="This is what happens when govenrments fail to give procedural due process. https://twitter.com/neilsorensen/status/882970032334098436" style="width: 300px; float: right;"/>
The most obvious application is to criminal proceedings, where alleged
criminals are guaranteed a <em>legal procedure</em> to defend
themselves. But it also extends to things like eminent domain: if the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Vogons
want to knock down Arthur Dent’s property to build an intergalactic
hyperspace bypass</a>, the Amendment would require that they notify
Arthur Dent (and the other residents of earth) and provide a <em>legal
procedure</em> to fight the demolition. Leaving a note at Alpha Centauri
doesn’t count.</p>
<p>Hence, this category of rights is called <em>procedural due
process.</em> The exact legal procedure to which we are entitled depends
on the circumstance. For example, those accused of violating criminal
laws are entitled to a procedure in which they can argue their
innocence.</p>
<p>But what if a state made a law saying everyone whose first and last
name starts with an ‘A’ needs to pay a fine to the government?
Procedural due process wouldn’t help Aziz Ansari, because he is clealy
guilty of having an A-name. In order to really have due process, the
Court decided, the government needs to prove that the law is not an
arbitrary limitation of freedom. This is caled <em>substantive due
process</em>, because it protects people from the <em>substance</em>
law. In order to get the highest level of protection, “strict scrutiny,”
from the Due Process Clause, plaintiffs have to show two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The government encroaches a right that is “deeply rooted in our
nation’s history and traditions.”</li>
<li>That encroachment is not “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
state interest.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Judicial review, the practice of the judiciary striking down some law
as unconstitutional, is not without controversy. It is inherently
“anti-majoritarian:” a small group of appointed political elites can
overturn the will of the people and their elected legislature. The point
of judicial review is to check the power of popular will against
narrowly and explicitly defined legal precepts; if 50.01% of people
decide to oppress the other 49.99% for no reason, the courts should be
able to prevent that. However, the courts are rightly reluctant to be in
the position of overturning the popular will.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The considered views and opinions of even the most highly qualified
scholars and experts seldom outweigh the determinations of the voters.
When challenged, however, the voters’ determinations must find at least
some support in evidence. —Judge Vaughn Walker in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry"><em>Hollingsworth
v. Perry (2010)</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2
id="incorporating-the-bill-of-rights-against-the-states">Incorporating
the Bill of Rights against the states</h2>
<p>Instead of the Privileges and Immunities Clause incorporating all of
the Bill of Rights against the states, as the framers intended, the
Supreme Court chose to incorporate individual pieces of the Bill of
Rights against the states on a case-by-case basis. Overtime most—but not
all—of the Bill of Rights has been incoprorated (for a list of each
amendment and its incorporation status, see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights#Specific_amendments">here</a>).
The most important for contemporary political descussion is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago"><em>McDonald
v. City of Chicago (2010)</em></a> because it deals with gun rights.</p>
<p>Prior to this case, it was an open question whether the Second
Amendment applied to states; Chicago assumed it did not and enacted
restrictive gun control, <em>completely banning</em> handguns. The
plaintiff stated that his home had been broken into multiple times, so
he needed a handgun to ensure his own liberty. Even the gun control
advocates must admit, owning a gun <em>is</em> “deeply rooted in our
nation’s history,” and a blanket ban on handguns is not a “narrowly
tailored” restriction. By this logic, the Court struck down Chicago’s
ordinance and decided the Second Amendment <em>does</em> apply to the
states. The Court does permit <em>some</em> regulation of guns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chicago can amend its gun laws to comply with this ruling while
continuing to have strong, comprehensive and Constitutional gun laws,
just as Washington D.C. has done [following <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller"><em>District
of Columbia v. Heller (2008)</em></a>]. — Justice Samuel Alito in
McDonald v. City of Chicago</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence claimed victory
following <em>McDonald</em>, because the Court clarified what gun
legislation was constitutional, and that includes many policies the
Campaign advocates for.</p>
<h1 id="equal-protection-clause">Equal Protection Clause</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The abolitionists expected that state governments would not start
treating the newly-freed slaves equally overnight. Hence, they wrote the
Equal Protection Clause. Given this, how could segregation have existed
for so long in the South?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court again minimized the impact of the Fourteenth
Amendment, to the point where the most egregious segregation was legal,
in four major decisions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Supreme Court noted in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Cruikshank"><em>U.S.
v. Cruikshank (1876)</em></a>, upheld in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases"><em>Civil Rights
Cases (1883)</em></a>, that the Fourteenth Amendment only limits
<em>state governments</em> not <em>individuals</em>; the relevant
sentence of the Amendment begins “No <strong>state</strong> shall…”
Private restaurants, hotels, and trains could—and did—exercise
discrimination.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court ruled in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breedlove_v._Suttles"><em>Breedlove
v. Suttles (1937)</em></a> that since the rules for the poll tax were
applied <em>uniformly</em>, it is consistent with the Equal Protection
Clause. It just so happens that these rules disadvantage certain racial
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court ruled in <a
href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lassiter_v._Northampton_County_Board_of_Elections/Opinion_of_the_Court"><em>Lassiter
v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959)</em></a> that a literacy
test was consistent with Equal Protection Clause as long as it was not
<em>intended</em> to descriminate on the basis of race. Of course,
courts rarely found such “intent” in the law.</p></li>
<li><p>The Court, infamously, asserted in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson"><em>Plessy v.
Furguson (1896)</em></a> that “separate but equal” segregation is
consistent with the Equal Protection Clause.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons, the Amendment failed to live up to its goals.
There were violations of even the watered-down Amendment: certainly some
of the literacy tests were intended to descriminate on the basis of
race, and certainly there were government-provided services which were
separate but <strong>unequal</strong>. But extra-legal factors prevented
challenges to the system of segregation. I consider it the <em>greatest
moral failing of the American justice system</em> that even the limited
guarantees of the Amendment were not provided to blacks in practice.</p>
<p>However, this was to be redeemed during the civil rights movement in
the mid-twentieth century. Each of the legal defects would be completely
reversed.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">The Civil
Rights Act of 1964</a>, justifying its authority to desegregate private
industries because on the Commerce Clause (segregation affected
interestate commerce) rather than the Fourteenth Amendment. This was
upheld in the landmark <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Atlanta_Motel_v._United_States"><em>Heart
of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964)</em></a> and led to the
reluctant disappearance of <em>de jure</em> segregation from the United
States.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Twenty-fourth
Amendment (1964)</a> made poll taxes unconstitutional for federal
elections and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_v._Virginia_State_Board_of_Elections"><em>Harper
v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966)</em></a> did so for state
and local ones. As far as I can tell, the court in <em>Harper</em>
arrived at a different conclusion because it consisted of different
justices than in <em>Breedlove</em>, thirty years prior.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzenbach_v._Morgan"><em>Katzenbach
v. Morgan (1966)</em></a>, the Court expanded a part of the Fourteenth
Amendment I have not elaborated here (the Enforcement Clause) which
would permit the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit literacy
tests.</p></li>
<li><p>The infamous “separate but equal” doctrine was struck down in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education"><em>Brown
v. Board of Education (1954)</em></a>. I could write a whole essay just
on the difference between in the Court’s reasoning in <em>Plessy</em>
and <em>Brown</em>, but the briefest summary is: the plaintiffs argued
that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It makes me imagine what would the country look like if the
Fourteenth Amendment was interpreted and drafted as it intended. What if
the Jim Crow Era never happened? In a few ways, American society still
hasn’t made up the progress gained in the height of Reconstruction—of
course, we have surpassed it in many other ways. The occupying Northern
Army took a stand against racial violence and had even eradicated the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#First_Klan:_1865%E2%80%931871">First
KKK</a> all the way back in 1871! Many states and districts <em>have
yet</em> to send a black person to congress since Reconstruction. When
they have, there is usually only just one.</p>
<p>And despite these recent legal victories, of course the fight against
racism is not over. It has largely pivoted to social, cultural, and
economic issues, rather than <em>de jure</em> segregation. We will see
how the Fourteenth Amendment is still a part of this fight, as
reformists are trying to use it to abolish money bail.</p>
<h2 id="sexual-equality-and-the-fourteenth-amendment">Sexual Equality
and the Fourteenth Amendment</h2>
<p>The Amendment never explicitly mentions sex discrimination, but it
seems an obvious consideration for the Equal Protection Clause. Again,
the courts would interpret the Amendment narrowly; It would take almost
a century to ensure that sex discrimination is protected, and in some
ways, the fight is still continuing today.</p>
<p>Susan B. Anthony wanted to argue that she was a citizen by birth and
that the right to vote was a privilege of citizenship. Therefore, it
should be extended to her by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.
However, Anthony could not get even this far. The authorities considered
her voting a <em>criminal violation</em> rather than a <em>civil</em>
one, so <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Susan_B._Anthony"><em>United
States v. Susan B. Anthony (1873)</em></a> could not even come before
the Supreme Court. Her jury of peers was all male; Anthony remarked this
paradoxically implies men are peers of Anthony even while they had a
right she didn’t. To top it off, the presiding judge, Justice Ward Hunt,
actually <em>instructed the jury</em> to find Anthony guilty. A
contemporary observer would remark, “Miss Anthony had no trial by jury.
She had only a trial by Judge Hunt.”</p>
<p>Even contemporary observers realized the <em>Anthony</em> trial was
little more than political theatre. Suffragists tried again in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_v._Happersett"><em>Minor v.
Happersett (1875)</em></a>. The judge ruled that voting was not a
privilege of citizenship. After all, some children and felons are
certainly citizens but none of them cannot vote. This case had a ripple
effect in limit suffrage in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breedlove_v._Suttles"><em>Breedlove</em></a>
and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassiter_v._Northampton_County_Board_of_Elections"><em>Lassiter</em></a>.
Women would need a constitutional amendment to claim the right to vote
instead, which they got in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Nineteenth
Amendment (1920)</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/raw-binary/most-important-amendment/ginsburg.jpg" title="Ginsburg in 1977, before her tenurship on the Supreme Court." style="width: 300px; float: right;"/>
In 1971, almost a hundred years after the first failed attempt to apply
the Fourteenth Amendment to sexual equality by <em>Anthony</em> and
<em>Minor</em>, the Supreme Court heard <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_v._Reed"><em>Reed v. Reed
(1971)</em></a>. Idaho had a law that privileged men over women in
deciding inheritance. The plaintiffs argued this violated their Equal
Protection Clause, and the Court agreed. Coincidentally, Ruth Bader
Ginsberg submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court she would later
be appointed to.</p>
<p>Since then, sex is protected by the Equal Protection Clause with
“intermediate scrutiny,” which is some progress, but many want to pass
the Equal Rights Amendment which would would protect sex at the highest
level, “strict scrutiny,” making it easier to win cases based on sexual
discrimination (see <a
href="https://eraeducationproject.com/doesnt-the-14th-amendment-already-guarantee-women-equal-rights-under-the-law/#learnmore">ERA
Education Project</a>). However, requiring only males to register for
the draft would not pass strict scrutiny, even according tolegal
scholars who favor the ERA (<a
href="https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2205&amp;context=hastings_law_journal">Hastings
Law Journal</a>). This was the source of much opposition at the time the
ERA was debated, since the feminist movement was linked with the
anti-Vietnam War movement. Today, 76% of women support the ERA according
to a <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/42b93fd7386089110543f4e1827ded67">2020
AP poll</a>, but only 38% of women agree with extending draft
registration to women according to a <a
href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/february_2016/most_women_oppose_having_to_register_for_the_draft">2020
Rasmussen Report</a>. As such, many feminists want to pass the ERA
<em>and</em> abolish the draft.</p>
<p>To add yet another complexity, a male-only draft-registration might
not even pass the currently-enforced intermediate scrutiny. The
challenge will probably fail, but we won’t know for sure until the
courts decide appeals on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_for_Men_v._Selective_Service_System"><em>National
Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System (2019)</em></a>. Feminist
advocates such as the National Organization for Women Foundation are
actually aligned with the National Coalition for Men, because such a
ruling would strengthen the definition of intermediate scrutiny under
the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p>In <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County"><em>Blostock
v. Clayton County (2020)</em></a>, the court would expand discrimination
the definition of “sexual discrimination” to include discrimination
based on sexual preference and sexual identity. This was argued in the
context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act Neil Gorsuch justifies the
expansion as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or
transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have
questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and
undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.
Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their
work would lead to this particular result. But the limits of the
drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands.</p>
<p>—Neil Gorsuch in the majority opinion of <em>Bostock</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reproductive rights:</strong> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut"><em>Griswold
v. Connecticut (1965)</em></a> provided contraceptive rights while <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade"><em>Roe v. Wade
(1973)</em></a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey"><em>Planned
Parenthood v. Casey (1992)</em></a> provided abortion rights, under
certain conditions. The Court found an <em>implied right</em> to
privacy, protected by the Due Process Clause, that makes blanket bans on
contraception and abortion unconstitutional. The Court permitted some
restrictions on abortion so long as they do not create an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_burden_standard">“undue
burden”</a> on the woman seeking an abortion.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges to affirmative action:</strong> The Court found
that affirmative action, in general was ok, but racial quotas were a
violation of the Equal Protection Clause in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_Univ._of_Cal._v._Bakke"><em>Regents
of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke (1978)</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election
Integrity:</strong> The commission wanted to compare voter rolls to a
database of non-citizens. The NAACP claimed that this would have a large
amount of false-positives, and that would disproportionately affect
minorities and violate the Equal Protection Clause, in <a
href="https://www.naacpldf.org/files/about-us/EIC%20Complaint.pdf"><em>NAACP
Legal Defense and Education Fund v. Trump, Pence, and Kobach
(2017)</em></a>. The Commission was dismissed before the case went to
court.</p>
<p><strong>The Presidential Election of 2000:</strong> The Court held
that Florida’s statewide recount did not enforce equal standards on each
county, so it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore"><em>Bush v. Gore
(2000)</em></a>. Bush won the original count by hundreds of votes (about
10<sup>-6</sup> of the total), and with the recount invalid, George Bush
became the 43rd President of the United States.</p>

<strong>Gerrymandering:</strong> The Court <em>almost</em> outlawed
gerrymandering in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_v._Bandemer"><em>Davis v.
Bandemer (1986)</em></a> under the Equal Protection Clause but later
found that no metric for deciding if a district map was gerrymandered
was suitable in <a

Jubelirer (2004)</em></a>. Even so, gerrymandering along racial lines
was prohibited <a

of United Latin-American Citizens v. Perry (2006)</em></a>, if a map did
not include enough majority-minority districts.</p>
<p><strong>Money bail:</strong> There is an as-yet undecided case called
<a
href="https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/odonnell-v-harris-county-texas-et-al/"><em>O’Donnel
v. Harris County</em></a> which alleges that the bail system used in
most of Houston, TX unfairly discriminates on the basis of wealth when
more reasonable alternatives are available.</p>
<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>
<p>In school, I had to memorize the preamble and was quizzed on the Bill
of Rights. The preamble has little bearing on understanding how the
government functions today, and the Fourteenth Amendment has had an
arguably greater impact on my life than the Bill of Rights by itself.
Investigation of it leads to several important lessons about liberty and
our constitution:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The fight for the civil liberties for a specific group is
fundamentally intertwined with the fight for freedom for everyone. The
Fourteenth Amendment, designed to protect newly-freed slaves is what
protects the right to bear arms, freedom from sexual discrimination, and
countless others.</p></li>
<li><p>The fight for racial equality isn’t just the Civil War or
<em>Brown v. Board</em>. The fight for gender equality isn’t just The
Nineteenth Amendment or The Civil Rights Act. These would evolve over
<em>multiple centuries</em> in a patchwork-quilt of legislative,
judicial, executive, social, and cultural battles. The struggle is by no
means linear and by no means won. We are still fighting the descendants
of the same fight today.</p></li>
<li><p>The American Constitution is a <em>living document</em>. At its
surface, it has been changed the constitutional amendments like the
Fourteenth, but, more subtly, the courts change it through case law.
<em>Plessy</em> and later <em>Brown</em> fundamentally changed how we
interpret the Equal Protection Clause. I was surprised to learn how many
landmark cases were only decided recently (<em>McDonald (2010)</em>,
<em>Obergefell (2015)</em>, <em>Blostock (2020)</em>). I think the
strength of the constitution is that it can be adapted to suit the novel
challenges of modern society.</p></li>
