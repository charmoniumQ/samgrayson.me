    We like to think that systems like human society have some predictable order, when in reality, history is driven by completely unpredictable random events.

    <h2 id="one-who-causes-history">One Who Causes History</h2>
<p>Think of the history of the twentieth century and who is most
responsible for it. You might be thinking of world leaders like Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, or Mao Zedong. Or perhaps you are
thinking of those who invented the technology that changed the world,
such as Albert Einstein or Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
<p>But I suggest a man you probably haven’t heard of named Gravilo
Princip.</p>
<p>The day started off poorly for Archduke Franz Ferdinand when three
security officials were left behind, by mistake. Then an assassin threw
a bomb at his car, and the rest is history!</p>
<p>Actually, it isn’t. The bomb bounced off his car and the exploded
without injuring the Archduke. The motorcade sped away to protect him
from any other assassination attempts. This moment is what Ceasar must
have felt when he exclaimed “The Ides of March have come, and I am still
alive!”.</p>
<p>Princip realized he lost his chance, so he gave up and went to a
nearby food shop. But when the motorcade started up again, someone
forgot to tell the driver to change the route. By the time the
Archduke’s staff realized, the transmission jammed in their automobile
(still a recent invention), so the it stopped <em>right in front of an
awe-stricken Pincip</em>.</p>
<p>By a ridiculous stroke of misfortune (or luck, depending on your
point of view), between the security officials being left behind, the
first failed assassination attempt, the driver not knowing the route,
the transmission jamming, Gravilo Princip had his opportunity. On June
28, Princip shot and killed Archduke Ferdinand, setting in motion a
chain of events which would result in the First World War.</p>
<h2 id="princips-butterfly-effect">Princip’s Butterfly Effect</h2>
<p>As you might know, the treaty which ended World War One involved
massive war reparations to be paid by the Germans. The German people
came to resent of these foreign powers spread, which fanned the flames
of nationalism represented by the Nazi Party. Thus begins World War
Two.</p>
<p>As you might know, the victors of World War Two partitioned off
Europe, and while they were doing so, certain tensions among the victors
emerged. This led to the stand off of the Cold War.</p>
<p>So Princip brought about a series of events which caused the Cold
War. Or perhaps the Archduke’s driver should be the one whom we say
brought about these events. Or perhaps the man who owned the food shop
that Princip stopped at, for if he were not there perhaps Princip would
gone to a different place that wasn’t on the motorcade’s route.</p>
<p>Some would counterargue that the Austro-Hungarian empire was already
ripe for conflict, and if not Princip, then someone else would set it
off. But if it was set off in the middle east as a result of Ottoman
aggression (there was unrest in the region ever since the Young Turk
Revolution). Maybe the alignment would have been different. Russia would
not feel compelled to defend the Slavic peoples, and maybe Russia uses
this hypothetical war to seek a warm-water port, and with the manpower
of Russia weighing on the other side of the scale, the outcome could be
drastically different. The specific details of these events can matter a
lot</p>
<h2 id="false-assumptions">False Assumptions</h2>
<p>We like to think that systems like human society have some
predictable order. We like to think that this order is affected by world
leaders and important people. We like to think that things happen for
compelling reasons. But when a world war breaks out on account of the
chauffeurs wrong turn, I realize that human society is so vastly complex
and intricate that some events are just so ‘out there’ to be
foreseen.</p>
<p>Historical trends and forces are powerful and determine the ‘steady’
events, like the US economy growing a few percentage points per year.
However The most interesting events that really make a change, like the
housing crisis or 9/11, are completely random and unforeseen, even by
scholars. That course of history wasn’t determined by simple rules ore
logical reasons. It’s just Lady Fortuna spinning her wheel.</p>
