this topic earlier. I have written and revised the same ideas in essay
form.</em></p>
<p>Most students will say math class is stupid and boring. As a math
person myself, I have to say: they’re right! Math taught in school is
twelve years of Pavlovian training to associate math with arbitrariness
and fear. Not only does this rob the student of a potentially enjoyable
experience, it robs the student of the transferable skills that are
exercised in math. I will give two examples.</p>

<h2 id="transferable-skill-problem-solving">Transferable Skill:
Problem-Solving</h2>
<p>Asking novel kinds of questions teaches students how to solve
problems they haven’t explicitly learned how to solve. In any job
position, you will be asked to do this. Some students are afraid to
trust their own original thoughts. Explicit practice with feedback can
help them eventually use their own intelligence when making choices. I
don’t think <em>only</em> asking novel questions to students is
necessarily a good idea, but I think we to ask more than none.</p>
<p>Here is a problem that requires original thinking to solve the first
time.</p>
<p>This is a checkerboard with dominoes where each domino takes up two
squares.</p>

<p>It can be tiled with dominoes without any overlap or dominoes hanging
off of the edge.</p>

<p>If I cut off the two opposite red corners, can I still tile the
board?</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">checkerboard with corners cut

</figure>
<p>You may identify one tiling pattern that does not work, but can you
convince me that <em>no</em> tiling pattern will work?</p>
<p>This is a tough question, but in cases like this, a teacher can ask
leading questions that guide the student to an answer for the difficult
question. For example, the teacher could ask,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How many squares are there on the original board?<br />
<details>
<summary>
Think before clicking
</summary>
Since the board is 8x8, there were 64 squares before the two corner
tiles were removed.
</details></li>
<li>After the corners are removed, how many of those that remain are
black? How many are red?<br />
<details>
<summary>
Think before clicking
</summary>
Out of the original 64, there must be 32 red and 32 black, but I cut off
two red squares. Therefore there are 30 red and 32 black.
</details></li>
<li>Can I place a domino such that it covers only two black
squares?<br />
<details>
<summary>
Think before clicking
</summary>
No. Each domino must cover one red and one black, no matter how it is
placed.
</details></li>
<li>Back to the original question, can all of the red tiles and all of
the black tiles be covered by dominoes?<br />
<details>
<summary>
Think before clicking
</summary>
No, because the are 32 black tiles, 30 red tiles, and each domino must
cover one of both. No matter how you do it, you will end up with 2
uncovered black tiles. <br />

</details></li>
</ol>
<p>Paradoxically, the teacher helped the student by asking more
questions. Students do not even need a grasp of math before they can
begin answering novel questions like this one.</p>
<p>This style of thinking is valuable without a mentor as well. Students
should learn that even though they can’t answer the big question, they
can still make up other small questions (using some of their own
ingenuity) which they can answer. Perhaps math units should start with
guiding questions, and then slowly allow the student to make up their
own questions. Currently, there is absolutely no incentive for students
to think of their own questions about the concepts they are
learning.</p>
<h2
id="transferable-skill-communication-explaining-and-persuading">Transferable
Skill: Communication: Explaining and Persuading</h2>
<p>The method of teaching used above is called the “Socratic method.”
Socrates famously <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno#Dialogue_with_Meno.27s_slave">explained
mathematics to an uneducated servant</a>. Explaining complicated things
in simple terms is an art. There is not necessarily a ‘right’ way of
explaining something, but some ways are better than others.</p>
<p>Currently math curriculum does not even attempt to challenge
students’ ability to explain and persuade. Students go on to their
future studies and jobs lacking the ability to explain something
technical to people who don’t already understand it and to convince
people of something they don’t already believe. These are both skills
that could be exercised in the context of math.</p>
<p>Here is an example. When I was in middle school, I was arguing with
my friends about whether 0.999… (repeating forever) was equal to 1. I
thought it was not the same as 1, but a hair less than 1. My friend Ben
was just as adamant that 0.999… exactly equal to 1. His explanation was
short, but persuasive.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He asked us if we believed 1/3 = 0.333… exactly, no approximation
(if you could expand the ellipsis infinitely). We of course agreed.</li>
<li>Then he asked us if 1 = 3 × 1/3 exactly. Nothing special here
either.</li>
<li>Then he said that 1 = 3 × 1/3 = 3 × 0.333… exactly. “Ok?” we
nodded.</li>
<li>When multiplying decimal digits, you multiply each digit by the
multiplier, so 3 × 0.333… = 0.999… exactly. We learned that years ago
and used it recently.</li>
<li>Hence 1 = 3 × (1/3) = 3 × 0.333… = 0.999… exactly. It’s just another
way of writing the same thing.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TINfzxSnnIE">Here</a> is an
entertaining presentation of this and similar arguments.</p>
<p>We were reluctant that there was more than one way of writing a
number in decimals—namely 1 and 0.999…—but logic has no such hesitation.
Once you go looking, you can find more examples of numbers with multiple
decimal names: 0 is 0 or -0, 4 is 4.00 or 4.0.</p>
<p>If you are still not convinced, you have to reject one of the
individual steps, but each step is exceedingly reasonable—even
obvious—in isolation. That’s what makes this argument so cogent. At each
step, he thought from our perspective: “what facts does my audience
already believe and how can I use <em>those</em>?”</p>
<p>Although he knew more math and jargon than us, he deliberately did
not use it because he wanted us to understand it. People with an
overinflated ego argue or ‘explain’ using complicated topics that “you
wouldn’t understand”; people of true intelligence argue or explain
something complicated <a
href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Thing_Explainer">using
simple terms</a>, <a
href="https://kottke.org/17/06/if-you-cant-explain-something-in-simple-terms-you-dont-understand-it">see
Richard Feynman</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps randomly assigned groups of students could present each
concept to the rest of the class. They would have to prepare a lesson
and field whatever questions or confusions the rest of the class had.
<em>Aside: one of my classes did this. It was illuminating to see the
differences in how other people understood and learned the concepts.
Talking out competing viewpoints exposed a lot of misconceptions,
sometimes even in the student-teachers. Without that experience, those
misconceptions <a
href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/115011/chapters/Why-Check-for-Understanding%C2%A2.aspx">might
never have been noticed and corrected</a>. What’s more, in these
discussions, it was explained exactly why the misconceptions are wrong,
and not just “because it is” or, worse, “because the teacher said
so.”</em></p>
<p>Perhaps classes should also incorporate proof-writing into their
class. Most math competitions (like <a
href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad">USAMO</a>
and <a
href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition">Putnam</a>)
do this and have efficient infrastructure for grading. Students should
be graded on mathematical correctness and “elegance.” I understand that
it would take more teacher-effort to grade these essay-like responses,
but I hope you see why I think that’s a good trade. While elegance can
be subjective, it is not more so than grading essays in English class. I
think the skill of explaining is inherently subjectively evaluated in
any form, but by no means should that complaint excuse us from
practicing a vital skill.</p>
<h2 id="making-things-better">Making Things Better</h2>
<p>I don’t know exactly how to incorporate these ideas. Surely there is
some value and wisdom in the traditional system; everyone needs to learn
fractions. I am merely pointing out that maybe we need some traditional
rote-learning mixed with novel problem-solving and communication, which
are currently absent completely. In English class, where there is time
allocated to appreciate the great masters and to express your own ideas
creatively. I think math can be studied more like English If not for the
sheer beauty of mathematics or blissful joy of creativity, then for the
pragmatism of transferable skills students could gain in the
process.</p>
<p>Twelve years of seemingly ceaseless mental drudgery extinguish any
remaining ember of mathematical creativity, curiosity, or inspiration
from students (see the wonderful <a
href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">A
Mathematicians Lament by Paul Lockhart</a> for more in this vein). It’s
no wonder most students hate math; I couldn’t do a better job of making
people hate it if I tried! It’s also no wonder that sometimes people at
their job act like mindless drones with no ability to improvise or
innovate in a self-motivated way.</p>
<p>I won’t pretend I am the first person on earth to notice this (see <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/sunday/math-teaching-football.html?module=inline">Math
Teachers Should Be More Like Football Coaches</a>). These ideas are
already implemented in some institutions. I was lucky enough to have
dedicated teachers who went above and beyond what was required to
implement these ideas. They also believed in me, and I am grateful for
that. I hope to follow their example with my own spin on things too.</p>
<h2 id="math-is-art">Math is Art</h2>
<p>From the Mayans to the Greeks, from Babylon to the Indus River, every
civilization has developed the disciplines of music, painting, and
<em>math</em>. It satisfies some basic human desire to explore the
unknown, express ideas, and awe at sheer beauty. Sometimes it happens to
be useful, but its purpose is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology">to be
beautiful</a>.</p>
<p>That’s what math actually is to those who practice it. You get to
make crazy up hypotheticals (e.g. “what if we had numbers whose squares
are negative?”) and investigate them to their logical conclusion
(e.g. complex analysis). There are many more of these: “are all
infinities equal?” gives cardinal and ordinal numbers, “could a computer
program prove everything?” gives computability theory and the
incompleteness theorem.</p>
<p>I have found many practical reasons to teach math differently, but
this is the one that resonates with me the most: math is a creative
pursuit, and keeping this a secret among math people prevents a lot of
people from experiencing the sublime, stupid-giddy, joy of being
creative in this way.</p>
