    UNIX shell isn&#39;t a real programming language, so stop using like one!

    <span property="inLanguage">en-US</span>
  </div>
  <div property="text articleBody">
    <p>UNIX shell isn’t a real programming language, so stop using like
one!</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, shell is extremely useful and powerful. However,
it is less <em>maintainable</em> than scripts written in real
programming languages. If you can afford to baby-sit the task and don’t
need it to be maintainable, then shell scripts are a fine choice.</p>
<p>The distinguishing factor between these “real” programming languages
and shell, for the purposes of this article, is the ability to define
datatypes. As Billy Beane famously remarked, “There are strongly typed
languages and weakly typed ones [both permit user-defined datatypes];
Then there’s 50 feet of crap, and <em>then</em> there’s shell.”</p>
<p><img src="/raw-binary/stop-writing-shell-scripts//moneyball.png" /></p>
<p>A cornerstone of UNIX wisdom is that “plaintext is the universal
interface.” Hence, it is not strongly typed; it’s <em>stringly</em>
typed. - After all, floats, ints, strings can all be encoded as strings.
- Lists of such can be colon-separated (like <code>$PATH</code>),
space-separated (like shell arguments), tab-separated (like
<code>ls -l $file</code>), or line-separated (like <code>find</code>). -
Lists of lists of such can be represented as a line-separated list of
tab-separated lists (like <code>ls -l</code>). I call these <em>simple
datatypes</em>. Representing <em>complex datatypes</em> is done on an
even more ad hoc basis.</p>
<h3 id="simple-datatypes">Simple datatypes</h3>
<p>Even within simple datatypes, life is hard: if
<code>var="name with space"</code>, then <code>command $var</code>
expands to <code>command name with space</code> (<code>$var</code> is a
makeshift list) rather than <code>command "name with space"</code> by
default, when the programmer usually intends the latter. While this
behavior can be avoided with quotes around <code>"$var"</code>, this
default makes it easier to write shell scripts incorrectly in a way you
won’t notice until you try a specially-crafted string.</p>
<p>Quoting does not even solve the problem completely. Suppose
<code>var='a "b c"'</code>. Then <code>"$var"</code> expands to one
argument (<code>a "b c"</code>), while <code>$var</code> expands to
three (<code>a</code>, <code>"b</code>, and <code>c"</code>). According
to the all-knowing <a
href="https://superuser.com/questions/1066455/how-to-split-a-string-with-quotes-like-command-arguments-in-bash">Stack
Overflow</a>, there is no variant which expands to two arguments
(<code>a</code> and <code>b c</code>) short of writing your own lexer in
shell or calling <code>eval</code>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8442467">defender of
shell</a> says “We should strive to build our software… so that
exceptions like a filename with an odd character in it just don’t exist.
Until we reach that point, computers will continue to frustrate their
users for no good reason.” But there <strong>is</strong> a better way!
It’s using a real programming language.</p>
<p>The thorns of shell programming infect the rest of the system. For
example, <code>$PATH</code> contains a colon-separated list-of-strings.
What if one of those strings needs to have a colon in it?
<code>scp</code> also uses a colon to separate two elements of a pair
(the hostname and the path), but what if the filename contains a colon?
Colon is technically <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Comparison_of_filename_limitations">a
reserved character</a>, but this reservation is (usually) not checked
when creating a file–apparently the system prefers to silently fail
later on instead.</p>
<p>Good luck using a string in shell to hold non-trivial encodings or
binary data.</p>
<h3 id="complex-datatypes">Complex datatypes</h3>
<p>Complex datatypes are even more ad hoc. While Zsh and Bash
<em>do</em> have arrays and associative arrays, there is no way to pass
them between functions or compose them (no array of arrays). Perhaps,
the designers of shell did not envision so many tools requiring complex
datatypes. But today, a plethora tools I use regularly do. Instead of
plaintext, many newer tools (<code>kubectl</code>, <code>gcloud</code>)
often have an option to output structured data as JSON to losslessly
emit data for a real programming language.</p>
<p>The shell’s inability to natively represent datatypes affects how
people think about the rest of the system. For example, how should the
kernel communicate complex datastructures to userspace? Influenced by
shell, which can’t define data structures, many Unices use the filesytem
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs">sysfs</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">procfs</a>) to communicate
structured data. Unfortunately, over the years this has accumulated <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/378884/">a plethora of different ad hoc
representations</a> in Linux, and it is nearly impossible to <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/356152/">take a consistent snapshot</a>
of the data.</p>
<p>I have a friend who says any system operation I can do in Python, he
can do in an <code>awk</code>/<code>sed</code> one-liner. As a one-off
command, I understand that’s a useful skill. But if you need to do this
task in a stored procedure, this is the <em>least</em> maintainable
option. If anyone needs to tweak the task (including the original author
after one month), they usually have to figure out what it does and
<em>rewrite another one</em>, hopefully in a real language this
time.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond">Eric S.
Raymond</a>, classic UNIX hacker, weighed in against shell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a general scripting language shell sucks <em>really badly</em>
compared to anything new-school. Performance, portability, you name it,
it’s a mess. It’s not so much the shell interpreters itself that are the
portabilty [sic] problem, but (as Magnus implicitly points out) all
those userland dependencies on sed and tr and awk and even variants of
expr(!) that get dragged in the second you try to get any actual work
done.</p>
<p>Some old-school Unix habits have persisted long past the point that
they’re even remotely sane. Shell programming at any volume above a few
lines of throwaway code is one of them - it’s <em>nuts</em> and we
should <em>stop doing it</em>.</p>

<h3 id="knuth-vs-mcilroy-is-orthogonal-to-ditching-shell">Knuth vs
McIlroy is orthogonal to ditching shell</h3>
<p>Someone is bound to mention the famous spar between Doug McIlroy and
Donald Knuth (much has been written regarding this: <a
href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/">summary</a>,
<a
href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/donald-knuth-was-framed/">Knuth
was framed</a>, <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200225/">Knuth
wasn’t framed</a>, <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18699718">HN debate</a>).
Donald Knuth was asked to compute word frequencies from its input (“a”
=&gt; 10, “the” =&gt; 7, “them” =&gt; 3, …). He wrote a 6-page Pascal
program from scratch and invented a novel datastructure. Doug McIlroy
wrote a 6-line shell program which did the same thing.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>tr -cs A-Za-z &#39;\n&#39; |
tr A-Z a-z |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -rn |
sed ${1}q</code></pre>
<p>The transferrable point of McIlroy’s comment was that Knuth built
everything from scratch to maximize asymtotic performance, while McIlroy
wrote an equivalent although less performant solution by cobbling
together existing tools. Nothing about it is inherent to shell or pipes.
I would offer this Python program:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> sys, collections, re</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>N <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">int</span>(sys.argv[<span class="dv">1</span>])</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>text <span class="op">=</span> sys.stdin.read()</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>words <span class="op">=</span> re.findall(<span class="st">&quot;[a-z]+&quot;</span>, text.lower())</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>counter <span class="op">=</span> collections.Counter(words)</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(counter.most_common(N))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I believe it carries the same lesson from McIlroy’s solution (since
it reuses tools: <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">regular expressions</a>
and <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter">collections.Counter</a>),
but unlike McIlroy’s solution, it’s easier to read, easier to modify
(try making it split words containing apostrophes more intelligently),
gives better error messages (try passing in a non-integer argument), and
it’s about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56958255/1078199">4
times faster</a>.</p>
<h3
id="poor-datatypes-implies-poor-programming-language-constructs">Poor
datatypes implies poor programming-language constructs</h3>
<p>Not everyone likes exceptions, but you have to agree a
<em>stacktrace</em> is useful (for example, pass a non-integer argument
to the previous program). Shell by default doesn’t even stop for errors,
and if you unset that default (<code>set -e</code>), it doesn’t tell you
what line errored out. You have to enable printing all lines
(potentially many!) with <code>set -x</code> to get remotely useful
diagnostics.</p>
<p>It is difficult to do parallelism in shell. Because shell is based on
fork-and-exec, there is no such thing as lightweight thread-level
parallelism. As for process-level parallelism, you’ve got the option to
manually pass around pids (<code>command &amp; ; pid="${!}"</code>), use
<code>xargs</code>, or use <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>. It’s
only fun for the very simplest kinds of problems.</p>
<p>In many shell expressions, undefined variables behave the same as the
empty-string (no datatype to represent <code>null</code>). This has led
to horrible bugs that delete <a
href="https://github.com/valvesoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671">the
whole home directory</a>.</p>
<p>Lack of datatypes implies the inability to statically
<strong>or</strong> dynamically check types. Even Python can emit
type-errors dynamically.</p>
<p>And all variables are a global by default??</p>
<h1 id="actionable-advice">Actionable Advice</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Stop writing shell scripts! Instead reach for a <em>real</em>
language like Python. You can still benefit from reusing software, but
at a language-level.</p></li>
<li><p>Write functions instead of scripts, function parameters instead
of script arguments, <code>return</code> instead of <code>echo</code>,
and objects instead of stringified data. This makes your software easier
to reuse than a shell script.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have to call out to shell, bubble-wrap the shell command
in a regular function. This is good software engineering, it permits you
to switch to a native API call later on, and
<code>clang(..., debugging_symbols=True)</code> is far more readable
than <code>clang ... -g</code> if you don’t remember what
<code>-g</code> stands for.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Implement a language-level interface first, and then a
command-line interface that sanatizes the inputs and calls into the
language-level interface. It’s good software engineering practice, and
it also gives other programs the option of composing at the
language-level. I like to use <a

<li><p>Add a <code>--output={json,text,auto}</code>. <code>json</code>
is good if the other program is written in a real programming language
(they can just <code>json.load(sys.stdin)</code>). It also permits using
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"><code>jq</code></a> to
slice-and-dice the JSON instead of <code>sed</code>/<code>awk</code> to

<li><p>Packages are the only piece I don’t have a good strategy for yet.
Here are the strategies I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a shebang that activates your environment, e.g. <a
href="http://iam.travishartwell.net/2015/06/17/nix-shell-shebang/">Nix
Shebang</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv-shebang/">Pipenv
shebang</a>. This is probably the best option.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="shell"><code>#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i python3 -p python3 python34Packages.pygobject3 libnotify gobjectIntrospection gdk_pixbuf
import gi</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>try</code> importing a package, and if that fails tell the
user what to install. This option is only feasible for a few
dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a runner like <a
href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx</a>. This is clumsy for
frequently used scripts because you have to write <code>pipx</code>
before them.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>virtualenv</code> (perhaps managed by Pipenv or
Poetry). You can activate the env from within the script by writing
<code>sys.path.insert(0, ...)</code> (if you can assume the user has the
right version of Python). It’s kind of ugly.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>cx_freeze</code> to compile your script into an
executable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>More advice regarding the CLI can be found at <a
href="https://clig.dev/">clig.dev</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve implemented these ideas in many projects, including my most
recent: <a href="https://illixr.github.io/">ILLIXR</a>. We used to have
a shell script to build-and-run the system, then a
<code>Makefile</code>, and then I upgraded it following the guidelines
in this section to a <a
href="https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/tree/master/runner/runner/main.py">launcher
script</a>. The script makes it far easier to launch ILLIXR different
configurations programatically.</p>
<h3 id="cons-of-a-real-language">Cons of a Real Language</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I must concede that the UNIX REPL, despite its warts, is
efficient for those who invest time in it. It is useful to build a
script out of commands one can test at a REPL.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps real-language REPLs will become more ergonomic (like <a
href="https://xon.sh/">Xonsh</a>), and satisfy the need for rapid
prototyping while using real datatypes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Python is far more complex and difficult to implement from
scratch than a shell.</p></li>
<li><p>Python scripts are somewhat less portable since they depend on
Python, but they are also somewhat more portable since Python is a
compatibility layer over the underlying OS (most Python scripts are
trivially Windows and UNIX compatibile!).</p></li>
<li><p>It may be less debuggable, because the intermediates are not
human-readable plaintext.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be partly mitigated in two ways: In a language context, one
can give objects a printable representation
with<code>__str__/to_string</code> (often defined automatically);
between processes, one can change<code>--format=json</code> to
<code>--format=text</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing small shell utilities makes it easier to interact with
other languages. Perhaps, <em>this</em> is Doug McIlroy’s vision. Not
just reusing software but doing so at the CLI-level rather than
language-level.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be partly mitigated by writing a language-interface first
and a shell-interface on top. This is common practice, as demonstrated
by <a href="https://tqdm.github.io/">tqdm</a>, <a
href="https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#module-serial.tools.miniterm">Pyserial’s
miniterm</a>, <a
href="https://pypi.org/project/jinja-cli/">jinja-cli</a>, and <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html"><code>http.server</code></a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-new-vision-for-shell">A new vision for shell?</h3>
<p>The case against using the UNIX shell as a REPL is less clear cut.
Most of my arguments regarding maintainability and edge-cases carry less
weight at the REPL since they only have to work once, under an
engineer’s supervision. Any change to the shell threatens the existing
repertoire of “muscle memory,” honed over decades. But even only as a
hypothetical consideration, it is worth imagining what shell
<em>could</em> be if it supported datatypes natively.</p>
<p>Inventing a language is hard work, so why not reuse an existing one?
Most existing languages are a bit too verbose, butone can write a
front-end with syntactic sugar. This is exactly what <a
href="https://xon.sh/">Xonsh</a> does for Python and <a
href="http://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-Shell">Ammonite</a> does for Scala.
Although the resulting syntax may resemble UNIX shell, real datatypes
are flowing through the pipes. See <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11vZzXCfAA0aOFAuHA0nAvAzALGFGCH-dqHxx6XMgbk8">Beyond
Bash</a> for an exposition of this philosophy by Ammonite’s creator.</p>
<p>A more revolutionary approach is to fulfill the vision of shell, but
in a modern context with datatypes. This is what PowerShell tries to
be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I originally took the UNIX tools and made them available on Windows,
and then it just didn’t work. Right? Because there’s a core
architectural difference between Windows and Linux. On Linux,
everything’s an ASCII text file… In Windows, everything’s an API that
returns structured data… I came up with this idea of PowerShell… It’s a
pipeline of objects and with the objects, you know, there’s none of the
prayer-based parsing.</p>

Be Continuous</a></p>

<h1 id="discussions">Discussions</h1>
<p>This is not an original idea, but I think my presentation of it is
unique.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3329668">This HN
thread</a> is particularly prescient.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jhpriestley</code> reads McIlroy’s point about composition
specifically to shell, while I would say that reusing language libraries
is “composition” as well.</li>
<li><code>nwmcsween</code> says exactly what I was thinking,
“Composition should be of libraries or algorithms not arbitrary black
box programs with n different options”. But I would amend this to say
that black-box composition is a <em>fallback</em> if you have to go
between languages and don’t have enough time to write a native API.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ted Kaminski applies a similar critique <a
href="https://www.tedinski.com/2018/05/08/case-study-unix-philosophy.html">to
UNIX philosophy</a> more broadly; he says what I am trying to far more
generally and eloquently. I have chosen to focus my ire on just shell
scripts because I hope to make more progress arguing the most narrow,
concrete, and practical point first.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8437687">This HN
Thread</a> also features a lively debate.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>felixgallo</code> points out that teaching shell is easier
than teaching a map, reduce, and filter. I won’t argue the subjective
point of which is easier, but it is incontroversial that most CS
students are more interested in learning a real language than shell for
employability reasons.</li>
<li><code>rsync</code> says there is no better alternative, while
<code>felixgallo</code> claims one is 20 years away, since existing
tools would have to be ported. Here’s the better alternative: Python for
scripts, Xonsh for REPL. It already has an equivalent of most tools
(<code>ls -&gt; os.listdir</code>, <code>tr -&gt; re.sub</code>, etc.),
the tools can be trivially ported (like
<code>wc -l -&gt; open(...).read().count("\n")</code>), or existing
tools can just be wrapped in a function that calls out to shell.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11vZzXCfAA0aOFAuHA0nAvAzALGFGCH-dqHxx6XMgbk8">Beyond
Bash by Li Haoyi</a> is a more persuasive argument on why Bash is
insufficient and why Scala is a better replacement than Python. With a
special library, Scala scripts are less than twice as verbose as the
equivalent Bash script. The author raises an important question: For a
webservice striving to have availability, how can one be confident that
a deployment workflow <em>works</em>? With Bash-based Puppet scripts,
there are a ton of subtle pitfalls and input-dependent “gotchas”
(e.g. spaces in strings), and the whole thing is untestable. Not only is
Scala a real progrmaming language that has sane datatypes, Scala has an
advanced yet ergonomic type-checker which can be leveraged to eliminate
many classes of runtime errors.</p></li>
<li><p>In an entertaining talk called <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCZJblyT_XM">The Unix
Chainsaw</a>, Gary Bernhardt espouses a seemingly opposite viewpoint,
but I think it is mostly consistent with my view.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gary Bernhardt shows examples where shell is extremely useful and
powerful.</li>
<li>However, I would caveat that shell is often less maintainable than a
real programming language (thesis of this post).</li>
<li>Gary Berhardt points out that not all things need to be maintainable
(they can be “half-assed”). I have to agree. Many people use shell
one-liners for things they only have to do once.</li>
<li>My problem is when shell scripts start taking the place of a real
program. This goes back to Li Haoyi’s point, “how can you be sure that a
tool is going to still work with new inputs if it is written in
shell?”</li>
<li>So it boils down to learn both so you can <em>use the right tool for
the job</em>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>I am genuinely interested in opposing opinions, so drop a comment
explaining why shell scripts are useful. Disqus’s free tier now has
disgusting ads, so I switched away from it. You can comment in one of
these places instead:</p>
