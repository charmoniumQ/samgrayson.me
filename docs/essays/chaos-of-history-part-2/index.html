    Can history be described by mathematical formulae?

    <span property="inLanguage">en-US</span>
  </div>
  <div property="text articleBody">
    <p>In a <a href="/essays/chaos-of-history-part-1">previous post</a>, I
talked about how a few random events can greatly change history. In this
post, I will describe that idea more mathematically.</p>
<h2 id="a-thought-experiment">A Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>Let’s say I throw a rock straight up into the air and measure how far
away it falls 10000 times. <em>I have too much free time.</em> I can
plot that distance against the number of falls. You would expect most of
them to fall very close to where I threw the rock. You would expect
far-away falls to be pretty rare.</p>
<p>We might suggest that this fits a Gaussian distribution (that’s what
most people associate bell-curve). Most physical phenomena roughly
follow a Gaussian distribution. Towards the far right, the probability
is very small. It should be rare that I would toss a rock straight up in
the air and see it land 20 meters away. The far left and far right are
called the ‘tails’ of the distribution.</p>
<p><img alt="Gaussian distribution" src="/raw-binary/chaos-of-history-part-2/gaussian_distribution.png" style="margins: auto;"/></p>
<h2 id="haphazard-stroll">Haphazard Stroll</h2>
<p>Now let’s say I throw the rock in the air, but this time I walk to
where it landed and throw the rock in the air again from that point.
This is called a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>, and
here is what it looks like when the rock falls based on a Gaussian
distribution. For good measure, I will run 5 random walks starting from
different spots in different colors.</p>
<p><img alt="Gaussian random walk" src="/raw-binary/chaos-of-history-part-2/gaussian_random_walk.png" style="margins: auto;"/></p>
<p>But I want to talk about another distribution: the Cauchy
distribution. It is very similar to the Gaussian distribution, but it is
ever-so-slightly higher at the tails (hence it is called a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution">fat-tailed
distribution</a>). This means that extreme outcomes are still rare, but
slightly less rare. People often too quick to assume that a bell-curve
shaped distributions are Gaussian, as <a
href="http://rocketscienceofwallstreet.blogspot.com/2012/04/nassim-nicholas-taleb-against-gaussian.html">some
would argue</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Gaussian and Cauchy distribution" src="/raw-binary/chaos-of-history-part-2/gaussian_and_cauchy.png" style="margins: auto;"/></p>
<p>But the difference seems small. Let’s see how these distributions
differ in a real experiment. I’ll take a random walk using the Cauchy
distribution and look at the differences</p>
<p><img alt="Cauchy random walk" src="/raw-binary/chaos-of-history-part-2/cauchy_random_walk.png" style="margins: auto;"/></p>
<p>In the Gaussian random walk, no single rock-throw really moved us far
from the origin. None of the throw were really ‘out there’. In each
Cauchy random walk, most of the throws didn’t affect the outcome that
much, but there were one or two really impactful throws that did most of
the moving (especially in the blue and green random walk). Outliers are
still rare, but when they do occur, they are <strong>hugely
influential</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-historical-analogy">The Historical Analogy</h2>
<p>I suggest that many historical phenomena act have analogous behavior.
One example might be, the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand;
another might be the Gulf of Tonkin incident, 9/11, or the battle of
Thermopylae.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> historical trends and forces, but they are often
realized by single explosive events. There was a general trend of
anti-imperialism in the early twentieth century. Even though most
movements of that trend were minor, it only took one explosive
assassination to change world history irrevocably.</p>
<h2 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the Future</h2>
<p>The <em>average value</em> of a Gaussian or Cauchy distribution is
zero (move neither to the left or to the right). <em>On average</em>,
when we throw the rock straight up, it lands on top of me. The left
moves will cancel out the right moves and it will end up not far from
where starts (the distribution is symmetric). The <em>average</em> may
be easy to predict, but <em>reality</em> might be different.</p>
<p>In the Gaussian random walk, most of the moves are medium. In the
Cauchy most of the moves are very small, or very large. A few very
extreme moves cause most of the movement away from the expected value.
As a result, the average predicts reality quite poorly. It would have
been completely debunked by any one of those extreme moves.</p>
<p>This is why markets are so difficult to predict. There are a few
unpredictable and extreme events which cause most of the movement
(called “black swan events”). On average, prices are constant or
increasing steadily (due to inflation), but then the OPEC declares an
embargo and the price of oil becomes 300% larger. Or hurricane Katrina
hits. That is an unlikely and extreme event that screws up the models.
<a
href="https://dollarvigilante.com/blog/2016/08/09/nassim-taleb-warns-biggest-black-swan-event-coming.html">Some
argue</a> that lack of recognition of black swan events played a part in
causing the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Should we try harder to predict black swan events with models? There
will never be enough data-points to do useful analysis of them because
of their characteristic rarity. The best we can do is remember that
every model is fallible and engineer the robustness necessary to handle
that fallibility. These are “unknown unknowns” in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">the parlance
of Donald Rumsfeld</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse unlikely with impossible.</p>
