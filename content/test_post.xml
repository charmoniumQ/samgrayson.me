	  <strong>Semantic HTML</strong> is the use of <a href="https://google.com/">HTML</a> markup to reinforce the <a>semantics</a>, or meaning, of the information in webpages and <em>web applications</em> rather than merely to define its presentation or look---Semantic HTML is processed by "traditional web browsers" as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users...

	  HTML has included semantic markup since its inception.[1] In an HTML document, the author may, among other things, "start with a title; add headings and paragraphs; add emphasis to [the] text; add images; add links to other pages; [and] use various kinds of lists".[2]
	</p>
	<p>
	  Various versions of the HTML standard have included presentational markup such as &lt;font&gt; (added in HTML 3.2; removed in HTML 4.0 Strict), &lt;i&gt; (all versions) and &lt;center&gt; (added in HTML 3.2). There are also the semantically neutral span and div elements. Since the late 1990s when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content.[3]
