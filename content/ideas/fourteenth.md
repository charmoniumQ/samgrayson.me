# The Most Important Constitutional Amendment You've Never Heard Of

<!--
The Civil War was a sordid affair. [More Americans died in the Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war) than World Wars I, II, Korean, and Vietname Wars _put together_. Only a goal so noble as the abolition of chattel slavery could justify such intense bloodshed and struggle.

In the aftermath of the war, the US constitution was amended in ways that would have profound effects far beyond their original intent of abolishing slavery. Specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment fundamentally rededicated the Union to the idaels limited government.
-->

This amendment lies at the heart of issues on the left _and_ the right: granting abortion rights, gay marriage, contraceptive rights, limiting gerrymandering, gun rights, limiting affirmative action, resolving the famous Presidential Election of 2000, and the status of women in the draft. It is even responsible for things we take for granted today like legalizing interracial marriage. If you care about any of these subjects, no matter you opinion, you have to understand the constitutional amendment at the center all of those debates, the most influential part of the constitution on daily life. It's not any of the Bill of Rights; They actually had a legal loophole that this amendment would close.

I am of course, referring to the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). The Fourteenth is unique even among other "freedom granting" amendments because it does not protect any _specific liberty_ (for example, freedom of speech); Instead it protects _liberty in general_. As a consequence, it has been used to givef us liberties that its framers could never have imagined, such as access to contraception. This opens the door for a non-legislative policy response to unequal institutions like bail and police, when state and federal congresses are too gridlocked to act. But to get there, we have to start with the historical context.

# Historical Context (briefly)

The North won the Civil War and outlawed slavery in the [Thirteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) (finally). Being nominally free wasn't enough; abolitionists realized that the federal government needed to protect the newly freed slaves from persecution. They legislated the Fourteenth Amendment to protect their freedom. It was written to apply to all Americans, so it has huge implications for society today. There are three important clauses for us today: the Priveleges and Immunities Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause.

<!--
I am going to describe four clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment (Birthright Citizenship, Privileges and Immunities, Due Process, and Equal Protection) and explain why they are still important today.

# Birthright Citizenship Clause

The Supreme Court decided in [_Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) that black people could not be US citizens, even if they were free. This is despite the fact that black men were voting citizens in five of the thirteen states that originally adopted the US constitution. With just half a century of retrospect, this decision beacme unanimously regarded as terribly, horribly wrong. Therefore, Citizenship was the first constitutional liberty which would need to be extended to the recently freed slaves.

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

The Fourteenth Amendment overrules _Dred Scott_, establishing ["birthright citizenship"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) for the United States. This clause declared everyone _born on US soil_ citizens, even if their parents were not. This is is unique, [even among other modern, liberal democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli#/media/File:Jus_soli_world.svg), which generally grant citizenship if the parents are citizens. I think birthright citizenship carries a symbolic importance because it establishes that the US would be _a nation of equals_; everyone born an American would be a citizen, regardless of who your parents were.

The framers could not have imagined what impact this would have on immigration policy, which was scarcely an issue in 1868. If illegal immigrants give birth on US soil, their child becomes a US citizen. Depending on your political orientation, this creates a perverse incentive for illegal immigrants to bear children in the US, or it is an essential part of protecting rights for newly born Americans. In any case, we are stuck with it for now; unlike the rest of immigration law, birthright citizenship is a part of the constitution, so it is extremely difficult to remove or modify.
-->

# Privileges and Immunities Clause

I am not a legal scholar or historian, so I may have mistakes; feel free to mention them in the comments.

[The Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights) is the first ten amendments to the constitution, which guarantees a litany of rights including:

- Freedom of religion
- Freedom of speech
- Right to bear arms
- And others

However, all of these limitations on governmental action only apply to the **federal government** not **state governments**. The framers largely trusted the state governments and were only skeptical of a tyrannical federal government for three reasons:

1. The idea of the thirteen former colonies operating as a single nation was still new. They volunteered to work together in the Revolutionary War and then in the Articles of Confederation, but still mostly operated as a loose confederation of states while the Constitution was being drafted.

2. State governments were directly elected, while many parts of the federal government were indirectly elected or appointed (the Senate, the President, the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the cabinet, etc.).

3. The seat of federal power was distant given the modes of transportation available at the time, but the state capitol was usually only a few days away by horseback.

In general, the state governments _were_ responsive to their people&hellip; as long as the "people" were white and male. Abolitionists in the North saw that the South couldn't be trusted to be anything but tyrannical to the newly-freed slaves. The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 set out to rectify what the framers of the Bill of Rights in 1789 overlooked: the Constitution would need to limit state governments in order to preserve civil liberties for all Americans.

> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;

However, the effect of this clause all hinges on how one defines "privileges and immunities." The framers intended to include the Bill of Rights and other rights, but they did not want to enumerate them lest the amendment be limited to _only_ the Bill of Rights. However, this plan backfired: in a 5-4 decision known as [_The Slaughter-House Cases (1873)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughter-House_Cases), the Supreme Court interpreted "privilges and immunities" narrowly, not _even_ including the Bill of Rights! This single decision renders the whole clause nearly irrelevant, and it is rarely used today.

Yale Law Professor [Akhil Amar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhil_Amar) wrote "virtually no serious modern scholar--left, right, and center--thinks that _Slaughter-House_ is a plausible reading of the [Fourteenth] Amendment." The Court usually gives deference to the intention of the framers, and in this case, the Congressional record itself holds their discussion that they intended the Amendment protect the Bill of Rights! Unfortunately, once the Court settles on something, it is extremely difficult to reverse, due to a doctrine known as [_stare decisis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent#United_States_legal_system). Instead, legal advocates would turn to the Due Process Clause to provide the basic freedoms of the Bill of Rights for the newly-freed slaves.

<!--
For those who are unfamiliar, I will refer to court cases in italics. The person suing to change the status quo is the "plaintiff" while the person being sued is the "defendant," abbreviated _Plaintiff v. Defendant_. Some cases get grouped together and given an alternative title like _The Slaughter-House Cases_ or just _Slaughter-House_.
-->

However, there are some signs that almost a hundred-and-fifty years later, the court is willing to revisit this decision. Justice Clarence Thomas in _McDonald v. City of Chicago_ (which I will describe later), used the Privileges and Immunities Clause to arrive at his decision, indicating he may be willing to overrule _Slaughter-House_ in the future.

# Due Process Clause

> nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;

The most obvious application is to criminal proceedings, where alleged criminals are guaranteed a _legal procedure_ to defend themselves. But it also extends to things like eminent domain: if the [Vogons want to knock down Arthur Dent's property to build an intergalactic hyperspace bypass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), the Amendment would require that they notify Arthur Dent (and the other residents of earth) and provide a _legal procedure_ to fight the demolition. Leaving a note at Alpha Centauri doesn't count.

Hence, this category of rights is called _procedural due process._ What exact legal procedure depends on the circumstance. The Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean the person whose liberty the government wants to deprive needs to have a chance to defend themselves. For example, those accused of violating criminal laws can try to prove that they are innocent.

<!--
The "due process of law" is a phrase which originates in the Magna Carta, where it prohibits the king from injuring the subjects for an arbitrary reason; it has to be for some enforcement of law by the legislature (Parliament, in their case). The United States version goes even further: it limits even what laws can be made by the legislature (fedral and state congresses).
-->

But what if a state made a law saying everyone whose first and last name starts with an 'A' needs to pay a fine to the government? Procedural due process wouldn't help Aziz Ansari, because he is clealy guilty of having an A-name. In order to really have due process, the Court decided, the government needs to prove that the law is not an arbitrary limitation of freedom. This is caled "substantive due process," because it protects people from the _substance_ law. In order to get the highest level of protection, "strict scrutiny," from the Due Process Clause, plaintiffs have to show two things:

1. The government encroaches a right that is "deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions."
2. That encroachment is not "narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest."

<!--
- If a law infringes on a _fundamental right_, the courts apply _strict scrutiny_: it must be both "narrowly tailored" and "least restrictive means of furthering a compeling state interest." A fundamental right must be "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" or "deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions" according to [_Duncan v. Louisiana (1968)_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Duncan_v._Louisiana/Opinion_of_the_Court).

- If a law infringes on some other liberty (not a fundamental right), the courts apply _rational basis review_: the law must be "rationally related" to a "legitimate" government interest. If the courts find a law violates any of these tests, they can use their power of _judicial review_ to strike it down.
-->

Judicial review, the practice of the judiciary striking down some law as unconstitutional, is not without controversy. It is inherently "anti-majoritarian:"  a small group of appointed political elites can overturn the will of the people and their elected legislature. The point of judicial review is to check the power of popular will against narrowly and explicitly defined legal precepts; if 50.01% of people decide to oppress the other 49.99% for no reason, the courts should be able to prevent that. However, the courts are rightly reluctant to be in the position of overturning the popular will.

> The considered views and opinions of even the most highly qualified scholars and experts seldom outweigh the determinations of the voters. When challenged, however, the voters' determinations must find at least some support in evidence.
> --Judge Vaughn Walker in [_Hollingsworth v. Perry (2010)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry)

## Incorporating the Bill of Rights against the states

Instead of the Privileges and Immunities Clause incorporating all of the Bill of Rights against the states, as the framers intended, the Supreme Court chose to incorporate individual pieces of the Bill of Rights against the states on a case-by-case basis. Overtime most--but not all--of the Bill of Rights has been incoprorated (for a list of each amendment and its incorporation status, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights#Specific_amendments)). The most important for contemporary political descussion is [_McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago) because it deals with gun rights.

Chicago had enacted expansive gun control: it _completely banned_ the handguns (remember the Second Amendment does not apply to the states by itself). The plaintiff stated that his home had been broken into multiple times, so he needed a handgun to ensure his own liberty. Even the most pro-gun control must admit, owning a gun _is_ "deeply rooted in our nation's history," and a blanket ban is the antithesis of a "narrowly tailored" restriction, the Court reasoned as they struck down Chicago's ordinance. The Court does permit _some_ regulation of guns, however.

> Chicago can amend its gun laws to comply with this ruling while continuing to have strong, comprehensive and Constitutional gun laws, just as Washington D.C. has done [following [_District of Columbia v. Heller (2008)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller)].
> -- Justice Samuel Alito in McDonald v. City of Chicago

Even the Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence claimed victory following _McDonald_, because the Court clarified what gun legislation was constitutional, and the things the Campaign advocates are explicitly permitted. To think this all started from an amendment made on behalf of the newly freed slaves&hellip;

# Equal Protection Clause

> nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws;

<!--
The Court has come to understand this as _if the state wants to treat some class of people differently, they had better have a damned good reason_. It adopted the concept of "tiered scrutiny" from the Due Process Clause; Descriminationon the basis of race and citizenship-status ([_Plyler v. Doe (1982)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe)) merited "strict scrutiny" while descrimination based on primary language ([_Meyer v. Nebraska (1923)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_v._Nebraska)) would only require "rational basis scrutiny."
-->

The abolitionists expected that state governments would not start treating the newly-freed slaves equally overnight. Hence, the wrote the Equal Protection Clause. Given this, how could segregation have existed for so long in the South?

<!--
Immediately after the Civil War, the abolitionists used three tools to protect the freedom to the newly freed slaves:

1. Constitutional amendments prohibited molestation by the government: The [Thirteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) abolished slavery, The [Fourteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) protects civil liberty, and The [Fifteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) extends the right to vote.

2. Legislation prohibited molestation by individuals: [The Enforcement Act of 1870](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Act_of_1870) which prohibited conspiracies to prevent others from exercising their constitutional rights, including voting.

3. Perhaps most crucially, the Federal troops occupied the South, enforcing the prior two tools; Southern governments would likely have not enforced them without that oversight.

For a while, things were improving for the newly freed slaves people and black people. Each of the three tools beared some success: Many people voted for the first time, and black people were elected to congress. Congress chartered the Freedman's Bureau which fed the poor. The army had stamped out the [First KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#First_Klan:_1865%E2%80%931871) (unfortunately, it would not be the last). It wasn't perfect, there was certainly still oppression, but it was progress from the end of the Civil War, which itself is a turning point in American race relations. [Of course, history is not so linear as I am depicting; I am simplifying.]
-->

The Supreme Court again minimized the impact of the Fourteenth Amendment, to the point where the most egregious segregation was legal, in four major decisions:

1. The Supreme Court noted in [_U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Cruikshank), upheld in [_Civil Rights Cases (1883)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases), that the Fourteenth Amendment only limits _state governments_ not _individuals_; the relevant sentence of the Amendment begins "No **state** shall..."
<!--
 With this interpretation of the Amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and Enforcement Act of 1870 were largely declared unconstitutional.
 -->

<!--
In the [Colfax Massacre](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/07/the-colfax-riot/378556/), a mob of white Democrats attacked a group of blacks and white Republicans attempting to occupy the offices they had been elected to in the courthouse. Usually the state courts try murders, but in this case the Louisiana State courts were not doing anything about it, so the Federal Government brought suit against the prepetrators using the Enforcement Act of 1870: they had conspired to prevent the victim's right to bear arms and right to assemble. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court and argued that the federal government had no constitutional basis to enforce the Act. The government argued that the basis came from the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled against the government, and this may actually be the right ruling. The relevant sentance begins "Nor shall any state deprive any person of liberty ... nor deny... the equal protection of the laws." It clearly only limits the _states_, not private individuals. This precedent was cited and upheld in _Civil Rights Cases_. This severely limiting the application of Fourteenth Amendment, and it implied private businesses could give segregated and unequal service.
-->

2. The Court ruled in [_Breedlove v. Suttles (1937)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breedlove_v._Suttles) that since the rules for the poll tax were applied _uniformly_, it is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause.

3. The Court ruled in [_Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959)_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lassiter_v._Northampton_County_Board_of_Elections/Opinion_of_the_Court) that a literacy test was consistent with Equal Protection Clause as long as it was not intended to descriminate on the basis of race.

4. The Court, infamously, asserted in [_Plessy v. Furguson (1896)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson) that "separate but equal" segregation is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause.

<!--
The third tool of abolitionists I mentioned earlier had also vanished: the Northern Army had left in accordance with the [Compromise of 1877](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877).
-->

For these reason, the Amendment failed to live up to its goals. There were violations of even the watered-down Amendment: certainly some of the literacy tests were intended to descriminate on the basis of race, and certainly there were government-provided services which were separate but **unequal**. But extra-legal factors prevented challenges to the system of segregation. I consider it the _greatest moral failing of the American justice system_ that even the limited guarantees of the Amendment were not provided to blacks in practice.

<!--
1. Systemic barriers: victims of oppressions would likely not have the time, money, or knowledge to spend on a suit.

2. Institutional barriers: many lawyers and judges refused to argue or hear cases relating to civil rights.

3. Intimidation: The [Second KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Second_KKK) used violence and the threat of it on opponents of segregation.
-->

However, this was to be redeemed during the civil rights movement in the mid-twentieth century. Each of the legal defects would be completely reversed.

1. Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the [The Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), justifying its authority to desegregate private industries because on the Commerce Clause (segregation affected interestate commerce) rather than the Fourteenth Amendment. This was upheld in the landmark [_Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Atlanta_Motel_v._United_States) and would lead to the reluctant disappearance of _de jure_ segregation even from the most Solid of the South.

2. The [Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) made poll taxes unconstitutional for federal elections and [_Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_v._Virginia_State_Board_of_Elections) did so for state and local ones. As far as I can tell, the court in _Harper_ arrived at a different conclusion because it consisted of different justices than in _Breedlove_.

3. In [_Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzenbach_v._Morgan), the Court expanded a part of the Fourteenth Amendment I have not delineated here (the Enforcement Clause) which would permit the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit literacy tests.

4. The infamous "separate but equal" doctrine was struck down in [_Brown v. Board of Education (1954)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education). I could write a whole essay just on the difference between in the Court's reasoning in _Plessy_ and _Brown_, but the briefest summary is: the plaintiffs successfully argued that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."

It makes me imagine what would the country look like if the Fourteenth Amendment was interpreted and drafted as it intended. What if the Jim Crow Era never happened? In a few ways, American society still hasn't made up the progress gained in the height of Reconstruction, although we have surpassed it in many ways, like private and public integration, voting rights, and prohibition of poll taxes. The occupying Northern Army took a stand against racial violence and had even eradicated the [First KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#First_Klan:_1865%E2%80%931871) in 1871. Many states and districts _have yet_ to send a black person to congress since Reconstruction. When they have, there is usually only one.

And despite these recent legal victories, of course the fight against racism is not over. It has pivoted to social, cultural, and economic issues, rather than _de jure_ segregation.

-->

## Sexual Equality and the Fourteenth Amendment

The Amendment never explicitly mentions sex discrimination, but it seems an obvious consideration for the Equal Protection Clause. Again, the courts would interpret the Amendment narrowly; It would take almost a century to ensure that sex discrimination is protected, and in some ways, the fight is still continuing today.

Susan B. Anthony wanted to argue that she was a citizen by birth and that the right to vote was a privilege of citizenship. Therefore, it should be extended to her by the Privileges and Immunities Clause (this was concurrent with _Slaughter-House_). However, Anthony could not get even this far. The authorities considered it a _criminal violation_ rather than a _civil_ one, so [_United States v. Susan B. Anthony (1873)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Susan_B._Anthony) could not even come before the Supreme Court. Her jury of peers was all male; this paradoxically implies that men were both peers of Anthony _and_ they could vote when she couldn't. To top it all off, the presiding judge, Justice Ward Hunt, actually _instructed the jury_ to find Anthony guilty. A contemporary observer would remark, "Miss Anthony had no trial by jury. She had only a trial by Judge Hunt."

Even contemporary observers realized the _Anthony_ trial was political theatre. Suffragists tried again in [_Minor v. Happersett (1875)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_v._Happersett). The judge ruled that voting was not a privelege of citizenship. After all, some children and felons are certainly citizens but cannot vote. This case had a ripple effect in liminit suffrage. It was cited in _Breedlove_ and _Lassiter_. Women would need a constitutional amendment  to claim the right to vote instead, which they got in [Nineteenth Amendment (1920)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Donald Trump symbollically vindicated Anthony with a pardon on the 100th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment's ratification.

In 1971, almost a hundred years after the first failed attempt to apply the Fourteenth Amendment to sexual equality by _Anthony_ and _Minor_, the Supreme Court heard [_Reed v. Reed (1971)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_v._Reed). This time, however, the plaintiffs argued on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause, and the Court agreed. 
<!--
In [_Craig v. Boren (1976)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_v._Boren), the Court added a new level "intermediate scrutiny" (between strict scrutiny and rational basis scrutiny) for sex (although they almost adopted strict scrutiny for sex in [_Frontiero v. Richardson (1973)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontiero_v._Richardson)).

But this is where the as-yet unpassed [Equal Rights Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) could change the picture. The ERA, if psased, would require that sexual descrimination be evaluated at "strict scrutiny" rather than "intermediate scrutiny," according to the [ERA Education Project](https://eraeducationproject.com/doesnt-the-14th-amendment-already-guarantee-women-equal-rights-under-the-law/#learnmore).
-->

Sex is currently protected by the Equal Protection Clause with "intermediate scrutiny," which is some progress, but many want to pass the Equal Rights Amendment which would would protect sex at the highest level, "strict scrutiny," essentially making it easier to win cases based on sexual discrimination (see [ERA Education Project](https://eraeducationproject.com/doesnt-the-14th-amendment-already-guarantee-women-equal-rights-under-the-law/#learnmore)). However, requiring only males to register for the draft would not pass strict scrutiny, according to even legal scholars who favor the ERA ([Hastings Law Journal](https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2205&context=hastings_law_journal)). <!--The ERA's original framers seemed to think so too: there was an amendment to the ERA which would exempt draft registration from strict scrutiny, but it was rejected by congress.--> This was the source of much opposition at the time the ERA was debated, since the feminist movement was linked with the anti-Vietnam War movement. Today, 76% of women support the ERA according to a [2020 AP poll](https://apnews.com/article/42b93fd7386089110543f4e1827ded67), but only 38% of women agree with extending draft registration to women according to a [2020 Rasmussen Report](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/february_2016/most_women_oppose_having_to_register_for_the_draft).

To add yet another "however," a male-only draft-registration might not even pass the currently-enforced intermediate scrutiny. We won't know for sure until the courts decide appeals on [_National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System (2019)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_for_Men_v._Selective_Service_System). Feminist advocates such as the National Organization for Women Foundation are actualy aligned with the National Coalition for Men, because such a ruling would strengthen the definition of intermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.

<!--
# Inconsistencies

The Supreme Court is capable of sober, legal scholarship, but is also capable of using veneer of it to make decisions the members already wanted to make. For example, in 1937, _Breedlove_ explicitly legalized poll taxes while in 1966, _Harper_ explicitly prohibited them. There was no change in the underlying arguments or laws, just the composition of the court and public opinion, according to [Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1965/48).

There are even inconsistencies within the _same_ court: in _Bush v. Gore_, all the liberal justices who usually give an expansive reading of the Equal Protection Clause, argued for a contracted reading of it; All the conservative justices who usually argue a contracted reading of it did the opposite, according to legal scholar Geoffry R. Stone.

Then, the Federal Courts are also inconsistent with their application of the law. The Fifth Circuit Court struck down a Texas law banning the sale of sex toys in [_Reliable Consultants, Inc., v. Earle (2008)_](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1463059/reliable-consultants-inc-v-earle/), but the Eleventh Circuit upheld a very similar Alabama law in [_Williams v. Pryor (2000)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_v._Pryor).

# The Fourteenth Amendment Today

The most important I want to convey, is how this Amendment has an active role in policy today.

**Marriage Rights:** Extended to interracial couples and same-sex couples in [_Loving v. Virginia (1967)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) and [_Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) respectively on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause.

**Contraceptive and Abortion Rights:** Extended by [_Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut) and [_Roe v. Wade (1973)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade). The Court found an _implied right_ to privacy, protected by the Due Process Clause, that makes blanket bans on contraception and abortion unconstitutional (exact stipulations were modified in [_Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey)).

**Affirmative Action:** The Court found that affirmative action, in general was ok, but racial quotas were a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in[_Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke (1978)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_Univ._of_Cal._v._Bakke).

**Trump's Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity:** The commission wanted to compare voter rolls to a database of non-citizens. The NAACP claimed that this would have a large amount of false-positives, and that would disproportionately affect minorities in [_NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund v. Trump, Pence, and Kobach (2017)_](https://www.naacpldf.org/files/about-us/EIC%20Complaint.pdf). The Commission was dismissed before the case went to court.

**The Presidential Election of 2000:** The Court held that Florida's statewide recount did not enforce equal standards on each county, so it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in [_Bush v. Gore (2000)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore).

**LGBTQ Antidiscrimination:** The Court decided in [_Blostock v. Clayton County (2020)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County) that descrimination based on sexual preference or sexual identity constituted descrimination based on sex:

> An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. But the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.
> --Neil Gorsuch in the majority opinion of _Bostock_

**Gerrymandering:** The Court _almost_ outlawed gerrymandering in [_Davis v. Bandemer (1986)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_v._Bandemer) under the Equal Protection Clause but later found that no metric for deciding if a district map was gerrymandered was suitable in [_Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer). Even so, gerrymandering along racial lines was prohibited [_League of United Latin-American Citizens v. Perry_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_United_Latin_American_Citizens_v._Perry), if a map did not include enough majority-minority districts, on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause.

**Money bail:** There is an as-yet undecided case called [_O'Donnel v. Harris County_](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/odonnell-v-harris-county-texas-et-al/) which alleges that the bail system used in most of Houston, TX unfairly discriminates on the basis of wealth when more reasonable alternatives are available.

<!--
**Marriage Rights:** Bans on interracial marraige an same-sex marriage came under question in [_Loving v. Virginia (1967)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) and [_Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) respectively. The government would argue that the "right to _interracial_ marriage" and the "right to _same-sex_ marriage" were not deeply rooted in American tradition, so they were not protected by the Due Process Clause. Since _nobody_ was permitted to marry another of a different race or same sex, whites, non-whites, and both sexes were "equally burdened," the government reasoned. Hence, they satisfied the Equal Protection Clause. The Court, however, saw the "right to marriage" at stake not the "right to _interracial_ or _same-sex_ marriage;" rights cannot be defined by the identity of those who exercise them, the Court ruled. Marriage, in general, was certainly deeply rooted in American tradition, so it constituted a fundamental right. The government could show no compelling state interest so the Court overturned restrictions on interracial (unanimously) and same-sex marriage (on a 5-4 majority).

**Contraceptive Rights:** The Supreme Court decided 7-2 in [_Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut) to legalize access to contraceptives. They found that the right to privacy, especially marital privacy, was constitutionally protected by the Due Process Clause. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments guarantee freedom from government intrusion, which implies the right to privacy has been deeply rooted in American tradition. Hence, the Court found it as an _implied_ right that qualified for strict scrutiny against the Due Process Clause. The state had not shown any legitimate goal by restricting contraceptives, so the ban on contraceptives was struck down.

**Abortion Rights:** The "right to privacy" asserted in _Griswold_ sets the stage for [_Roe v. Wade (1973)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade). The Court found that the right to privacy, especially _medical_ privacy would make enforcement of abortion bans unconstitutional. _Roe_ was more controversial than _Griswold_, dividing the court 5-4. Even some proponents of abortion rights like Ruth Bader Ginsberg (not yet on the Supreme Court) considered it judicial overreach. Ginsberg would have rather made abortion rights into a legislative battle than a legal one. Nevertheless, _Roe_ is accepted precedent and reaffirmed (albeit with modifications) in [_Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey).

**Affirmative Action:** The Equal Protection Clause took center stage in challenges to affirmative action in [_Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke (1978)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_Univ._of_Cal._v._Bakke). In _Bakke_ the Court ruled that race-conscious admissions were ok, but racial quotas were not (at the time UC Davis tried to admit at least 16 black students for every 100 admittents). The compelling state interest was in creating a diverse student class, but a racial quota was not narrowly-tailored. In [_Fisher v. University of Texas (2016)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas_(2016)), the court reiterated that diversity-related goals of a university's affirmative action policy have to be explicitly measurable (which they were in _Fisher_), so the courts can tell if the policy is narrowly-tailored.

**Trump's alleged voter fraud:** The NAACP sued Trump ([_NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund v. Trump, Pence, and Kobach (2017)_](https://www.naacpldf.org/files/about-us/EIC%20Complaint.pdf)) over the committee he set up to investigate election fraud. They allege that cross-checking voter rolls against a database of resident non-citizens will generate false positives (e.g. someone who has the same name as a non-citizen), and those will be disproportionately Black and Latino which violates the Equal Protection Clause. Trump disbanded the committee before the case was heard.

**The 2000 Election:** The actual legal question in [_Bush v. Gore (2000)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore) was an Equal Protection argument: the plaintiffs argued and the Court agreed that the existing statewide recount did not enforce equal standards on each county. They argued even if that two voters submitted identical ballots in different counties, one may counted while the other is not. This was controversial, opponents reasoned, because if a recount is invalid because no consistent standard could be applied, how could the orginal count be valid? How can any state ever do a statewide recount in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause? The Court glossed over these, stating,

> Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.
> --_Per Curiam_ opinion in _Bush_

**LGBTQ Antidiscrimination:** The Court decided in [_Blostock v. Clayton County (2020)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County) that descrimination based on sexual preference or sexual identity constituted descrimination based on sex:

> An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. But the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.
> --Neil Gorsuch in the majority opinion of _Bostock_

[Gorsuch is a textual literalist, and it shows in this excerpt.] While Gorsuch was writing about the Civil Rights Act, I believe the same judgement applies to the Equal Protection Clause as well, since it also regards sex. Some historians believe Rep. Howard W. Smith (D-VA) introduced sex as a protected class in the Civil Rights Act of of 1964 as an effort to make it less popular; ironically, he inadvertantly paved the way for federal protection of women's rights and LGBTQ rights.

This was an extension of the precedent set in [_Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_Waterhouse_v._Hopkins). In _Price Waterhouse_, the plaintiff argued that she was denied partnership because she did not conform to the stereotype of what a female partner should look like. Presentation-as-male or as-female discussed in _Blostock_ is an extension of these stereotypes.

**Gerrymandering:** The Equal Protection Clause also influences how congressional districts can be [gerrymandered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) (drawn to support a certain candidate or party). First, the Court ruled in [_Davis v. Bandemer (1986)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_v._Bandemer) that gerrymandering based on partisanship _was_ justiceable under the Equal Protection Clause, but the plaintiffs had not been able to _prove_ the maps were partisan. [To show both sides are guilty, the California Democrats actually allied with the Indiana GOP to defend partisan gerrymandering.] Then in [_Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer), the Court upheld _Davis_ in theory, but found no proper standard for deciding if a map was partisan. This effectively "green-lighted" partisan gerrymandering across the United States. However, gerrymandering on the basis of race would be declared illegal in [_League of United Latin-American Citizens v. Perry_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_United_Latin_American_Citizens_v._Perry), if a map did not include enough majority-minority districts.

**Money bail:** There is an as-yet undecided case called [_O'Donnel v. Harris County_](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/odonnell-v-harris-county-texas-et-al/) which challenges the money bail system in Houston's primary county. The point of money bail is to limit the punishing someone by jailing or imprisoning them until _after_ a fair trial, while providing some assurance the defendant will show up. However, inability of poor defendants to pay bail imply they get jailed before their trial, which is an abridgement of their procedural due process rights. Trials take so long, that poor defendants often give a false confession, so _in practice_ they don't have their procedural due process rights. The plaintiffs want the decision to be based on evidence-based assessment of the flight risk rather than the crime, and they want judges to use money bail only as a last resort, citing alternatives including GPS supervision, state supervision, or non-monetary bail.

# Why I wrote this article

In school, I had to memorize the preamble and was quizzed on the Bill of Rights. The preamble has little bearing on understanding how the government functions today, and the Fourteenth Amendment has had an arguably greater impact on my life than the Bill of Rights by itself. Investigation of it leads to several important lessons about liberty and our constitution:

- The fight for the civil liberties for a specific group is fundamentally intertwined with the fight for freedom for everyone. The Fourteenth Amendment, designed to protect newly-freed slaves is what protects the right to bear arms, freedom from sexual discrimination, and countless others.

- The fight for racial equality isn't just the Civil War or _Brown_. The fight for gender equality isn't just The Nineteenth Amendment or The Civil Rights Act. These would adapt and persist across _multiple centuries_ in a patchwork-quilt of legislative, judicial, executive, social, and cultural battles. The struggle is by no means linear and by no means won. Even just looking at the KKK, it began to terrorize blacks just when it looked like abolitionists had guaranteed victory by wining the Civil War. At first it thrived, then it was stamped out by the Enforcement Act, but other extrajudicial terror organizations took its place, then the Enforcement Act was struck down, then... and now _we're still fighting its descendants today_ . For example, the [Unite the Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) included some self-proclaimed advocates of _de jure_ racial inequality.

- I also realized, while researching this article, that the American Constitution actually affects the daily lives of Americans. We owe a lot of things, abortion rights, contraceptive rights, gun rights, gay marriages, interracial marriages, and desegregation. More than this, the constitution is a _living document_. Most obviously, it has been changed the constitutional amendments like the Fourteenth, but, more subtly, the courts change it through case law. _Plessy_ and later _Brown_ fundamentally changed how we interpret the Equal Protection Clause. I was surprised to learn how many landmark cases were only decided recently (_McDonald (2010)_, _Obergefell (2015)_, _Blostock (2020)_). I think the strength of the constitution is that it can be adapted by the courts to suit the novel challenges of modern society.
