# Spanish vs Esperanto

1. Self-expression
2. Fun of languages, philology, wordplay
3. Diverse community perhaps because it didn't become a universal second language
3a. Pen pals, local meetups, conferences
3b. Diversity of cultures, age nationalities, etc.
3c. Values, but not necessarily finevinko

# Constructed Language (conlang)

Auxiliary language
Engineered language
a priori language
a posteriori language

# Esperanto

LL Zamenhof in late 1800s from all world languages
Despite attempting to make Esperanto culturally neutral, it sounds vaguely Indo-European and is closest to Polish.
Political overtones: unite the world, pacifism

Designed to be learnable and speakable
Community, penpals, cultural exchange, https://www.pasportaservo.org/
Nearly no native Esperantist, level playing field

# Lojban

Designed to be precise and unambiguous
Unambiguous words vs unambiguous grammar
"Pretty little schoolgirls"
Expressions not possible in English
Applications in machine translation, semantic web, formal reasoning (conversational Prolog), and programming (variable names)
(break these down for general audience)

- Lojban is more similar to knowledge-representation programming, while Esperanto is more similar to natural languages. I already know a lot about knowledge-representation languages, but I only speak English.
- Only a few people can speak Lojban at the speed of thought, but many can do so for Esperanto, even with little training. Speaking is different from reading and writing, and I want to learn a way to express myself in speaking.
- Esperanto has a more populous community. If I vacation Europe, I may be able to find Esperantists to be my friends. Pasporta servo, local Esperanto clubs

Lojban is interesting from an academic point-of-view. If Esperanto is as Esperantists claim (basic conversations in a year), bI will return to Lojban.
Perhaps, I would be able to use Lojban in my computer science research.
