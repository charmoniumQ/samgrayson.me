You know how Americans might get a tattoo of some Japanese characters for the aesthetic not their actual meaning? (Or they might even be maliciously mislead about their meaning)

I learned an analogous thing happens in some Eastern Asian countries where English text conveys an aesthetic of sophistication, so some people put nonsensical English text on T-shirts or storefronts, and I thought it was totally wild.

For example, here is a storefront in Myanmar, where nonsensical English text is used decoratively. What is absolutely fascinating is that it is a nonsensical paragraph composed of somewhat sensical pieces, like "red neck bike." The text had to have been written by someone, so do you think they just copy/pasted from a ton of different sources?

I'm curious how the distortions got there. Did the writer editorialize a smattering of quotes? Did they use Google translate? I see something about "stetsons" (not "stet sons" as written) and "cows". "western rock then roll"

Also the phenomenon of wasai-eigo is fascinating. It's these words in Japanese that are composed of English borrow words, but composed in an idiom that is unique to Japanese. To quote Wikipedia,

An example is handorukīpā (ハンドルキーパー, "handle-keeper"), derived from "handle" with the meaning of "steering wheel", with the full phrase meaning designated driver.

I obviously recognize the underlying words, but not the idiom they are used in.

It's just fascinating to think that English and Western culture doesn't belong to anybody, so people can remix it and integrate it into their own pidgins, creoles, or just use it for it's aesthetic sense.

When Japan occupied Korea during WWII, they actually gave Korean some of these wasai-eigo, so there are some things that Korean people think are English, but are really also Japanese.

What if some of them go full circle and back into English? That's kind of like pokèmon, which began as a Japanses borrow of "pocket monster," and now we have borrowed that (brands usually don't get changed, except maybe the pesky grave accent) back into English.
