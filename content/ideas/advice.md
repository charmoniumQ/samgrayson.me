Most people are horrible at giving advice, and I have silently endured it, nodding in agreement it for almost two-and-a-half decades. Here are my observations:

Most advice-givers egregiously overgeneralize. If something was a certain way for them in the past, it is that way for everyone in perpetuity. Often, they na&iuml;vely fail to acknowledge the possibility of variation between different experiences of the same thing, and the possibility that conditions have changed since they formed their observations. For example, "Good students go to class.". I know a few counterexamples of this claim, and I'm sure you do too.

The cause of this tendency to confidently overgeneralize could be a symptom of the [Dunning-Kruger effect][3]. People believe since they have experienced a situation once, they are an expert on all experiences of that situation. Most situations people give advice for (marriage, school, career) are influenced by chaotic processes, so we have little reason to expect one experience will be anything like another, even if they have similar starting points.

Many say to [never use so-called weasel words][1] such as "_may_" (the irony of encountering incorrectly overgeneralized advice while searching for how to write advice is not lost on me). However, the utility of advice-giver's goal is not to win an argument; It is to convey observations. There is an important difference between certainties and a probablies. Using words like "may" to convey this difference is called [linguistic hedging][2], and it can be useful for the advice-reciever to know the advice-giver's degree of confidence ("can" be useful; that's a hedge).

The advice-reciever knows more about their own goals than the advice-giver. Perhaps, the advice-receiver's goals are so different that the advice-giver's strategy is detrimental. There seems to be a unquestioned cultural pressure (Nietzsche's [slave morality][5]) for students to get the highest grades they can.

Then, is giving good advice impossible?

Note: My opinion on this has changed since I wrote this draft. I think the human mind is accustomed to "exceptions-based" reasoning; universal quantified statements are so rare in human experience (outside of mathematics), that most people don't mean their universal quantifiers literally. It is understood that "all birds can fly" really means "most birds can fly"; likewise "good students go to class" is really understood as "most good students go to class." It is different than Dunning-Kruger, which refers to a specific kind of over-confidence with skills-based domains (e.g. driving, burgling, public speaking), not general life advice. If I were to continue this essay, I would go more into the theme "giving good advice requires listening" instead.

- Actionable advice
- Not obvious; impactful
- Bad example: "Try to start college off on the right foot."

- State facts instead of rules

- Positive nothings
- Example: "Never give up"

Better advice:
- Weasel words
- Doubt yourself
- Recommendations conditioned on goals
- Can I omit this?
- Positive **somethings**

I realize the irony of giving advice on giving advice, but I'm doing this anyway. I contend that I am practicing what I recommend.

Better way of sharing

One can also avoid overgeneralizing by stating anecdotal facts instead of rules. "When I was falling behind, going to class helped me regain my footing." The general rule is false (we know counterexamples), but this anecdote is true. It also contextualizes the experience in the environment of the advice-giver, which may have different conditions than now. The advice-reciever then selectively applies the advice.

Most advice is offered for free, and it is worth its price.

Thus, the first thing said by the advice-giver should be a question, "what do you want from this experience?". If, even further, one can eliminate the rigidly asymmetric roles of advice-giver and advice-reciever, this invites the possibility of a meaningful conversation about what the goals should be, which can be enriching for both participants.

Empathize with the advice-receiver. Ask questions about their feelings to inform your imagination, when you imagine being them.

Instead, consider "Going to class may prove helpful if you are falling behind.". This acknowledges that class can be useful in a specific way, but is not some absolute universal good. Even if one is falling behind, going to class might still might not fix that problem (perhaps the lectures are not informative), as indicated by word "_may_".
