Tax on the value of land, not counting the structure on it.

- No deadweight loss.

- Progressive tax. There is no means by which landlords can shift the tax burden onto tenants or laborers.

- Value of land is created as an externality of community-development, so it is 'just' in some sense that the value goes back to the community. Thus it incentivizes communities to develop themselves. This tax does not diminish the reward earned by those who do work building or improving a structure on the land.

- It might be cheaper for someone who already owns land to leave land vacant or underutilized than to develop on it. However a ground tax would encourage its owner to develop it or sell it to someone else, encouraging high-density living and more efficient land use.

Other natural resources, especially non-exclusive resources, might be taxed the same way as they are claimed from nature. If geosynchronous orbits were taxed this way, companies running satelites that don't do very much are incentivized to sell their orbit to a company that will do something more profitible. It would disincentivize space trash, which is currently free to produce.
