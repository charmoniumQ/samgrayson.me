Tax on the value of land, not counting the structure on it.

- No deadweight loss.

- Progressive tax. There is no means by which landlords can shift the tax burden onto tenants or laborers.

- Value of land is created as an externality of community-development, so it is 'just' in some sense that the value goes back to the community. Thus it incentivizes communities to develop themselves. This tax does not diminish the reward earned by those who do work building or improving a structure on the land.

- It might be cheaper for someone who already owns land to leave land vacant or underutilized than to develop on it. However a ground tax would encourage its owner to develop it or sell it to someone else, encouraging high-density living and more efficient land use.

Other natural resources, especially non-exclusive resources, might be taxed the same way as they are claimed from nature. If geosynchronous orbits were taxed this way, companies running satelites that don't do very much are incentivized to sell their orbit to a company that will do something more profitible. It would disincentivize space trash, which is currently free to produce.

Regarding gentrification:
- It will be harder for poor people in poor houses in expensive neighborhoods
- But land speculation becomes more difficult; speculators would have to pay taxes while the land is vacant.
- Tax would price in the cost of amenities for nice neighborhoods; then people will become more indifferent to which neighborhood to live in.
- LVT encourages build more housing, which is the root cause of housing shortage.
- "Upzoning" can help, but it also creates an incentive for speculators to buy land and wait for it to get upzoned, which increases prices for the people living their. LVT makes zoning less necessary.
- LVT would make it hard for Mom & Pop shops in expensive business districts. On the one hand, maybe they should move if some other business can use that land more efficiently. On the other hand, maybe citizens could vote for historic business to be exempt from LVT. Exemption votes should be tied to a balanced increase in the LVT rate on everyone else, so voters would see the true cost of the policy. Using LVT with popular exceptions reflects the reality that in most cases, we want to incentivize the most efficient land use, but there are some historical or artistic uses whose value is not economic.

Regarding poor people who inherit expensive homes:
- They aren't the most efficient use of that land; it would be ok if they moved to a smaller location.
- They can reverse mortgage their home.

LVT would make the market price of real estate zero in the long run. Is this fair to people who paid a mortgage?
- Gradually apply the tax over three decades. Nobody should be surprised by it. Their sacrifice would still yield an advantage to them in the interim.

      - > A 2010 study on “Who Gentrifies Low-Income Neighborhoods” found that the impact of gentrification on black residents varies based on level of education. By examining around 15,000 census tracts in 64 metros from 1990-2000, the authors found that gentrification tends to benefit highly educated black households. In fact, one-third of the increase in income among gentrifying neighborhoods during this period came from the progress of this specific demographic. This in turn causes gentrifying neighborhoods to be more attractive to middle-class black households. But gentrification can also have a negative effect on less educated black households, by pushing those who did not complete high school out of gentrifying neighborhoods.
      - > That said, displacement can be and is a big issue in places where gentrification is occurring at a feverish pace. In her coverage of related research by the UC Berkeley Urban Displacement Project, my CityLab colleague Tanvi Misra points to the strong link between gentrification and displacement in a high-gentrification city like San Francisco. Over a quarter of San Francisco’s neighborhoods (422 of the nearly 1,600 surveyed) are at risk of displacement. The study’s lead author, Karen Chapple, writes that by 2030, San Francisco, Oakland, “and many other Bay Area communities may realize that their neighborhood has turned the corner from displacement risk to reality.”
      - > A 2013 Cleveland Fed study found that extensive gentrification is the province of a limited group of large superstar cities and knowledge hubs like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and Washington D.C. In three-quarters of America’s 55 largest cities, less than ten percent of all neighborhoods experienced gentrification from 2000-2007, and gentrification affected 5 percent or less of a total of 22 neighborhoods. Not surprisingly, these cities are the ones being hit hardest by displacement. And with real estate prices in these cities surging toward all-time highs, there is reason to believe that displacement may worsen over time.

      - > That gentrification displaces poor people of color by well-off white people is a claim so commonplace that most people accept it as a widespread fact of urban life. It’s not. Gentrification of this sort is actually exceedingly rare. The socio-economic status of most neighborhoods is strikingly stable over time. When the ethnic compositions of low-income black neighborhoods do change, it’s typically because Latinos and other immigrants move into a neighborhood—and such in-migration is probably more beneficial than harmful. As for displacement—the most objectionable feature of gentrification—there’s actually very little evidence it happens. In fact, so-called gentrifying neighborhoods appear to experience less displacement than nongentrifying neighborhoods.

    - Higher land-or-property-tax from LVT may displace people, but there will be a greater supply of housing from aligned incentives.
  - These studies assume that non-gentrifying and gentrifying places are in all other ways equal. Consider a world where all places are either rural-and-declining or urban-and-gentrifying. Assume for the sake of argument that residents leave rural due to lack of job opportunities and residents leave gentrifying places due to increased cost of living. A study done in this world would also find that gentrifying places have the same rate of displacement as non-gentrifying places. Rather the gentrification is making them leave gentrifying neighborhoods and the rural-ness is making them leave rural neighborhoods. If there was some policy that encouraged urban-ness without gentrification, perhaps there *would* be less displacement; studies that don't control for rural-ness can't eliminate that possibility. I don't actually believe in rural-ness, but that is just an example showing how the study doesn't lead to the stated conclusion. Vigdor 2002 uses some factors related to the householder and the house in Models 3 and 4, but no local-economic determinants of displacement.

    Another pitfall is controlling on too many variables. If a study controls for "rent-control" (as in Freeman and Braconi 2004), the difference between gentrifying and non-gentrifying neighborhoods may be explained away by the variable they are controlling for. For example, suppose rent-control increases displacement gentrification decreases displacement, and rent-controlled neighborhoods are more likely to gentrify. Then we would observe gentrified neighborhoods have equal or lower displacement, but that isn't because gentrification has lower displacement, it is because the rent-control cancels it out. It may be better policy to have no gentrification and have rent-control. I don't really believe that exactly, but I do believe there may be _some_ mediating variable that is incorrectly treated as an independent variable in the regression in Table 1.

    So as to not move the goal-posts, here's what would change my mind: a study (preferably peer-reviewed) that tests the effect of increased-cost-of-living on displacement, controlling for other the determinants of displacement (could be statistical control or just some kind of randomized control). I would prefer a study that uses a structural causal model (in the style of Judea Pearl), but since that is relatively new, I understand that it may not be well-applied in this domain. If not using a structural causal model, I would settle for a discussion of which variables to include to avoid confounds. In either case, the researchers _should_ test the exogeneous variables for collinearity, since that could potentially indicate a confounding causal relationship (and linear regression would be unstable anyway).
