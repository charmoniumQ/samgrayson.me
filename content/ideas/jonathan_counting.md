- 21st century = years whose digits start with 20
- numbers between a and b should be b - a: so counting has to be inclusive-exclusive. so between 0 and 1 should be 1 number.
- ranges over the alphabet
- ordinals vs cardinals
- Arithmetic on usical intervals
- Random randrange

Zero should be a natural number
- "First 2^n natural numbers" should only need n bits to represent
- Taylor's theorem
- Binomial theorem
- Factorial
- "Base case" for recursion is simpler
- Cardinal numbers should be a superset of natural numbers. In other words, cardinality of finite sets should be a natural number. Sets can be empty, therefore cardinality can be zero.
- It makes a commutative monoid with +

- 0^0 == 0
- on the one hand, 0^y == 0 for y != 0
- on the other hand, x^0 == 1 for x != 0
- These two facts, by themselves, don't suggest that x^y "should be" undefined, merely that x^y is not continuous.
- Definition of exponential as repeated multiplication, and "empty product" is 1.
- Number of ways to map x-element set to a y-element set
- Distinguish between the "value" 0^0 and the "limiting form" 0^0
- Indeterminate form. \(\lim\limits_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x)} = 0\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to x_0} \frac{g(x)} = 0\) does not imply \(\lim\limits_{x \to x_0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1\)
- On the other hand, in 1821 Cauchy explained why the limit of xy as positive numbers x and y approach 0 while being constrained by some fixed relation could be made to assume any value between 0 and ∞ by choosing the relation appropriately. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/X%5Ey.png
