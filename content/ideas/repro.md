A website could keep mutate the document at the URL to whatever the current policy is, or it could make the URL map to the same immutable document and add prepend a link to the latest when that changes.

The ACM has chosen to do *neither*: making some revisions to the semantic core of the text of the page at that URL (compare the 2017 snapshot [2] with the 2022 snapshot [3]), but not changing it all the way to the newest policy, which is at a totally different URL [4]. This makes it appear that Plesser misquotes the ACM in a significant way, when really the ACM changed their website under Plesser's feet, but not to the most up-to-date policy.
