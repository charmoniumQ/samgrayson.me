It seems to me that pro-choice rulings, Roe v Wade and Casey v Planned Parenthood, and pro-life draft ruling in Dobbs v Jackson are quite comparable. Both applied the "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition" analysis to determine if these rights are unenumerated fundamental rights referred to by the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. The key difference is that the pro-choice rulings looked at reproductive rights more broadly ("fundamental right of single women and married persons to choose whether to have children" in Roe, "the right of the individual to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child" in Casey) while the pro-life ruling looked more specifically at just "the right to obtain an abortion". As such, the pro-choice found ample evidence in historical tradition (Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, Skinner v. Oklahoma) supporting the supposed right while the pro-life rulings found no evidence supporting the supposed right.

One additional difference, the majority in Casey gives higher deference to stare decisis. The majority in Casey notes people may have built their lives assuming and depending on abortion rights granted in Roe, there has been neither "evolution in legal principle" nor "change in Roe's factual underpinning," and overruling Roe would result in "the country's loss of confidence in the Judiciary".
