The other is this longer strain where all of the failures in my life are all connected and culminated when I didn't go to MIT for undergrad. It sounds crazy because it is, but it is compelling to a less rational part of my mind. 

A friend of mine offered to host me at MIT and give me the "student's perspective."

I knew some friends there who were really excited to host me for a visit while I was in high school, and they couldn't wait for me to start. The tour was so good, I felt that MIT had a community of people like me that I had been wanting for a while. They have public-use soldering irons in the dorms; it was like heaven. But I didn't get in. I had to explain this on a lot of different occasions, and each time the other person reacted in shock, 

There are a lot of times I don't feel I did as well as I could for not putting enough effort in.
