# Feelings

As recently as the turn of the twentieth century, public executions with grotesque torturing were a common form of entertainment for people of all classes. I will let you imagine the sanguine details for yourself, rather than write it here.

However writings from people of that era do not indicate that onlookers vomitted or grimaced--reactions that we consider involuntary for modern people. There is nothing biologically different between us and them. Perhaps some involuntary actions are not instinctual, but are socially conditioned into us from birth.

What other automatic reactions has society programmed into us? Maybe laughing at certain things, or crying at others. To be sure, emotions such as sadness have been in the minds of people since there have been people; however the exact things we become upset about may be drastically different.

Would adolescent youth cry after being spurned by the target of their admiration? Would we have the same reaction to slavery that we do today?

What ideas would we be closed off too?

A historian [find name] said that most people living in sixteenth century France could not conceive of a world without God. The idea was so radical, it had not entered into consideration.
